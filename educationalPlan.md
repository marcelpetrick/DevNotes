# Bildungsplan

## 2021

### must
* project management: get some basic seminar and exam (certification); eighter IPMA, Prince2 (with Agile?) or IHK
* HSK1: basic Mandarin certification (this year for sure)
* machine learnin studies have to continue

### want
* start extra-occupational master studies

-------a goal for the time until end of April ------

## Scrum Master + Product Owner (Foundation)
* both offered by Scrum Alliance and scrum.org (they split up), great
* read: <https://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2020/2020-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf> !
* question is if to take a "one course fits both for foundation level", since I have ~5 years of experience with agile (lean management & scrum) or to take separate ones?

* take care that the stuff is officially tested and certified: 2 days à 8 hours are most of the times offered
* scrum alliance wants 2.400 to 2.500€ for "Certified Scrum Product Owner"; scrum.org calls it "Professional Scrum Product Owner" for 1.400 + VAT

* took & booked PSPO for end of March ... hey ho, let's go!
