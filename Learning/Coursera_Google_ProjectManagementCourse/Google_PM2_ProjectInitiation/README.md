# notes

```
Remember that effective objectives are:

Aspirational: Is the objective challenging and inspiring?

Aligned with company goals: Does the objective support company and/or departmental OKRs?

Action-oriented: Does the objective motivate the team to take initiative?

Concrete: Can the project team easily grasp the objective?

Significant: Will achieving the objective make a meaningful impact or change from where you are currently?
```

```
Each key result should address the following questions:

Does the key result help define success for your team?

Can it be measured to prove that youâ€™ve achieved your objective?

Is it specific and time-bound?

Is it ambitious yet realistic?
