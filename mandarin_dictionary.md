# my own dictionary for all Mandarin I've learnt so far

## hints for myself
* instead of just putting the words I've learnt so far (via Duolingo, evening school at MVHS, ..) I should tackle directly the HSK1-vocabulary: <https://improvemandarin.com/hsk-1-vocabulary-list/> - learn those 150 words and we are already fine
* also handle this <https://hsk.academy/en/learn/starting-with-learning-chinese>

## legend
simplified chinese, pinyin, english

## dict
再见 Zàijiàn - goodbye  
你好 Nǐ hǎo - hello  
我 Wǒ - I  
很 hěn - to be  
高兴 gāoxìng - very happy  

[TBC]
