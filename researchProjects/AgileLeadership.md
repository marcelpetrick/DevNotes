## Question 1

What are two key differences between an agile organization and a traditional organization?

An agile organization is characterized by its flexibility, adaptability, and a focus on innovation and continuous improvement, whereas a traditional organization tends to be more hierarchical, bureaucratic, and focused on stability and predictability. Two key differences between these two types of organizations are:

    Organizational Structure: An agile organization is typically organized into small, cross-functional teams that are empowered to make decisions and collaborate with other teams to deliver value to customers. In contrast, a traditional organization tends to be more hierarchical with a rigid structure and a clear chain of command. Decisions are made at the top and passed down through the ranks, which can slow down the decision-making process and limit innovation.

    Approach to Change: An agile organization embraces change as a constant and seeks to continually adapt to new market conditions and customer needs. The focus is on delivering value quickly and continuously improving processes and products. In contrast, a traditional organization tends to be resistant to change, preferring to maintain the status quo and stick to established processes and procedures. Change is seen as a disruption to stability, and it may take a long time to implement new ideas or initiatives.
