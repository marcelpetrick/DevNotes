# problem
* working in some agile framework; technically clear how to estimate features and bugs, working also works, done in sprints
* special setting: working as contractors for a stakeholder; tasks should be estimated and offered first, then confirmed (ordered) and then they can be processed
* high administrative overhead for the team lead to create, communicate and check all those tasks (single items)
* tracking hours is another non-lean process for the developers

# question
* what is the usual way to handle this in agile?
* drop it at all? just prepare a sum and charge-as-needed?
* use some tracking software as help for the developers?
* what about the overhead for managing/tracking the "Vorg√§nge"?
* actually tracking time should not be needed as long as you can finish the sprint on time (different situation)
