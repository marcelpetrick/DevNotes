18:30 AI at the Crossroads: Ethics, Technology and Regulation
Allison Fisher & Mario Tokarz (RightMinded AI)
This talk offers an introduction to the urgent need for addressing ethical challenges and complying with emerging legislation in AI development. The talk highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, discussing how technical and legal professionals can work together to shape a responsible and innovative future for AI.

18:50 Securing Human Rights in the Age of AI: A Guide for Corporate Responsibility
Alexander Kriebitz (iuvenal research)
Incorporating human rights into legally binding requirements for businesses has increased in recent decades. However, the increasing use of AI presents challenges, such as mitigating biases and ethical issues with data. The presentation explores how to interpret human rights obligations in the context of AI solutions and highlights tools for compliance. It focuses on human rights issues faced by companies in developing or deploying AI in health, autonomous driving, and human resources.

19:20 Value Based Engineering and IEEE 7000
Soner Bargu (WU Wien)
This talk offers an introduction to Value-based Engineering (VbE) and ISO/IEEE 24748-7000. VbE provides companies with a highly practical approach to master the value-based challenges of their digital transformation. The VbE methodology provides a broader lens to consider potential value harms associated with product or systems design. For better understanding how the new standard works in practice, this presentation will focus on providing examples on the basis of the project implemented for UNICEF.

19:50 Networking

## Intro by Allison (RightMinded AI GmbH)
* two ends of the spectrum (saves us all, never have to work again) versus AI is going to kill us all (Motherboard, drone simulation, etc, the one talk - uncalibrated reward system; see https://www.vice.com/en/article/4a33gj/ai-controlled-drone-goes-rogue-kills-human-operator-in-usaf-simulated-test )
* we shape technology and technology shapes us
* "AI is a tool we must wield to transform our nations.."
* but the messy middle is what matters most
* her first consulting project was to evaluate a bought AI software and the faculty members
![](img01.png)
* trolley problem: navigating ethical decisions in AI product and business development
* but engineers make hundreds of ethical decision every day

## Securing Human Rights in the Age of AI: A Guide for Corporate Responsibility
* Alexander Kriebitz (iuvenal research)
* AI development for companies as main focus; because very much driven by corporate entities
* PoV from academics and consulting; mixed experience which is helpful also for the evaluation, because of the ivory tower .. distance to the real world engineering problems
* growing divide between the biased AI and ethical AI
![](img02.png)
* regulation will not be able to fill all potential scenarios
* why do we have that kind of mismatch?
* issues:
  * complexity of AI ethics
  * use-case specific challenges: autonomous driving, medical, HR or finance
  * competing legal frameworks: EU AI act, national laws, frameworks, ..
  * involvement of business functions: procurement, human resources, product development
![](img03.png)
* the pivot to human rights in AI regulation is likely to change this
  * human rights are at the center and normative pillar of contemporary ethics
![](img04.png)
![](img05.png)
* the business and human rights angle matters highly for ESG ratings that determine access to finance and B2B clients
* European Supply Chain Legislation...
* Why does a company need an EU AI Act Impact Assessment?
![](img06.png)
* see the four different risk levels of AI developers
* TODO: map AI risks tailored to the company; and provide an report
* case study: Diabetes patient
![](img07.png)
![](img08.png)
* specificity of Health: fuzzy data and overlap between medical data and demographic features
* specificity of AI: biased data and limitations of hardware solutions

## public questions
* line between perceived human action and human action is betting smaller; interaction with chatbot versus a real doctor
* right now the human rights decision is really centered on real humans
* what if AI develops some real consciousness? not reached yet
* but what about closed integration of humans and robots
* for LLMs: what kind of overarching data-input is used for training? also clarifying if there is some cutoff or continuous new data makes the decision different
* question is also about non-deterministic and deterministic AI
  * for courtyard, etc much different

## Value Based Engineering and IEEE 7000
* Soner Bargu (WU Wien)
* SDLC - system development life cycle
* what to do to run an AI project with ethics inside
* value based engineering; UNICEF `yoma` project/platform
![](img10.png)
* will be IS/IEC/IEEE 24748-7000
* "certifAIed" group for getting certified
![](img11.png)
* can help companies to comply with the EU AI regulation
* can help investors to make better investment decisions
* IEEE7000 has 3 phases:
  * preparing of the grounds
  * eliciting relevant values
  * deriving value-based system requirements
* stakeholder representatives are reflecting on three moral questions: utilitarianism, virtue ethics, duty ethics
![](img12.png)
* value clusters are built bottom up from stakeholder remarks (explain the value without using another value - then you found a new value cluster)
* risk logic identifies system requirements
* creativity explodes in terms of product ideas
![](img13.png)
* value analysis leads to more sober investment
