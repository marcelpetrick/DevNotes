18:30 AI at the Crossroads: Ethics, Technology and Regulation
Allison Fisher & Mario Tokarz (RightMinded AI)
This talk offers an introduction to the urgent need for addressing ethical challenges and complying with emerging legislation in AI development. The talk highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, discussing how technical and legal professionals can work together to shape a responsible and innovative future for AI.

18:50 Securing Human Rights in the Age of AI: A Guide for Corporate Responsibility
Alexander Kriebitz (iuvenal research)
Incorporating human rights into legally binding requirements for businesses has increased in recent decades. However, the increasing use of AI presents challenges, such as mitigating biases and ethical issues with data. The presentation explores how to interpret human rights obligations in the context of AI solutions and highlights tools for compliance. It focuses on human rights issues faced by companies in developing or deploying AI in health, autonomous driving, and human resources.

19:20 Value Based Engineering and IEEE 7000
Soner Bargu (WU Wien)
This talk offers an introduction to Value-based Engineering (VbE) and ISO/IEEE 24748-7000. VbE provides companies with a highly practical approach to master the value-based challenges of their digital transformation. The VbE methodology provides a broader lens to consider potential value harms associated with product or systems design. For better understanding how the new standard works in practice, this presentation will focus on providing examples on the basis of the project implemented for UNICEF.

## Intro by Allison (RightMinded AI GmbH)
* two ends of the spectrum (saves us all, never have to work again) versus AI is going to kill us all (Motherboard, drone simulation, etc, the one talk - uncalibrated reward system; see https://www.vice.com/en/article/4a33gj/ai-controlled-drone-goes-rogue-kills-human-operator-in-usaf-simulated-test )
* we shape technology and technology shapes us
* "AI is a tool we must wield to transform our nations.."
* but the messy middle is what matters most
* her first consulting project was to evaluate a bought AI software and the faculty members

* trolley problem: navigating ethical decisions in AI product and business development
* but engineers make hundreds of ethical decision every day

## Securing Human Rights in the Age of AI: A Guide for Corporate Responsibility
* Alexander Kriebitz (iuvenal research)
* AI development for companies as main focus; because very much driven by corparate entities
* PoV from academics and consulting; mixed experience which is helpful also for the evaluation, because of the ivory tower .. distance to the real world engineering problems
* growing divide between the biased AI and ethical AI
![](img02.png)
* regulation will not be able to fill all potential scenarios
* why do we have tht kind of mismatch?
* issues:
  * complexity of AI ethics
  * use-case specific challenges: autonomous driving, medical, HR or finance
  * competing legal frameworks: EU AI act, national laws, frameworks, ..
  * involvement of business functions: procurement, human ressources, product development
![](img03.png)
* the pivot to human rights in AI regulation is likely to change this
  * human rights are at the cneter and normative pillar of contemporary ethics

* European Supply Chain Legislation...
* Why does a company need an EU AI Act Impact Assessment?

* see the four different risk levels of AI developers
* TODO: map AI risks tailored to the company; and provide an report
* case study: Diabetes patient
