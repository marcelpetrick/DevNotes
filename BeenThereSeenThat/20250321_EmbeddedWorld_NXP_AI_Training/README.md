# 20250312 Embedded World - NXP: AI Training

```

Date: Wednesday, March 12, 2025
Time: 9:30 - 12:30 CET (Germany Time)
Where: Nuremberg Messe, NCC Mitte, München 2
Duration: Three hours

Cost to attend: $30 US

In this three-hour, hands-on workshop, you will explore how the NXP FRDM Ecosystem simplifies AI and machine learning (ML) development, reducing complexity and providing all the necessary tools to accelerate your AI/ML journey. Using the new i.MX 93 Application Processor FRDM board, you will have the opportunity to test these resources and see firsthand how to develop an ML model with the NXP processors.

During the workshop, attendees will:

    Explore the FRDM ecosystem and its resources to simplify go-to-market designs for applications such as HMI, vision, machine learning, and more.
    Get acquainted with GoPoint, our intuitive interface that provides easy access to open-source demos for applications like object detection and voice control.
    Utilize our Application Code Hub to find NXP-developed and tested software examples, code snippets, and demos, helping you accelerate your development process.
    Easily create and train an object recognition ML model using our eIQ Toolkit.
    Deploy and test your object recognition model on the FRDM-IMX93 board.


By the end of this workshop, you will have learned how to utilize NXP's resources to jumpstart your machine learning development. From leveraging our GitHub with source code examples for machine learning, vision, human-machine interfaces (HMI), graphics, and more, to modelling your own data with eIQ Toolkit. You will be be ready to start incorporating AI/ML in your new projects and designs.

You’ll receive (and keep!) the FRDM-IMX93 development board, the first FRDM board to feature an i.MX Application Processor, making it a powerful tool for industrial and IoT application development.

Giveaway
The FRDM-IMX93 development board is the first FRDM board to feature an i.MX application processor, making it a powerful tool for industrial and IoT application development. It is equipped with an i.MX 93 processor that includes dual Arm® Cortex-A55 cores running at 1.7 GHz, a Cortex-M33 core at 250 MHz, an efficient Neural Processing Unit (NPU), the EdgeLock® Secure Enclave for enhanced security, and a Tri-Radio Wi-Fi + Bluetooth + 802.15.4 module soldered down.

HW/SW Requirements
All attendees should bring a laptop with the eIQ Toolkit and Tera Term installed (links to be provided once registered). The laptop needs at least one functional USB port. NXP will provide HDMI displays, USB cameras, keyboards, and touchpads for use during the training.
