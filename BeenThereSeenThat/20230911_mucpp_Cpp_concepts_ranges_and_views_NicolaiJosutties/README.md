* what are snders: lazy and asynchronous programming model
* sender consumer <-< sender factory
* async. and lazy
* GCC 11.3
* segmentation and registration of medical images
* develop sfotware in a way to maximize utilization of the hardware

```
* why not use a statemachine instead of functional composition?  unclear
* also maybe just te builder pattern

* completion signatures: why not eror messages at compile time?
  * PR2300R7 only supports a query, but most of the senders know their signatures beforehand
