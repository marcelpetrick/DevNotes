# 20230824Google: Gener AI  for developers

## first talk

* somene uses chatgpt to reate replys to transactional mails
* conceptual overviw:
  * deep learning as subset of ML as subset of AI
  * neural networks inspired of human brain..
  * google tensor proessing unit
  * lack of hardware, lack of opensource software
  *  advances, when those things became more affordable
  * discriminative versus generative techniques: classifycation versu generatin - label things based on an image OR create new content out of the description
  * many LLMs are "just" transformers: "attention is all you need" research aper
  * consists of encoder, self-attention-mechanism, very crcial for NLP tasks
  * more efficient than RNN oder content

  * this revolution started at Googleand we continue to innovate: BARD ..
  todo img01
  * genAI landscape: note taking, summarizing, writing replies, code generation, text to SQL, automate ..
  * four main areas: create new content, summarize, dscover, automate

  * problem: hallucinations are words or phrass that are generated by the model that are often nonsensical or grammatically incorrect
    * tries to provide answers, which don't exist clearly in the data; several attendees experienced such a case
    * the model is not reained on enough data, noisy or dirty daty, not given enough context, not given enough constraints
    * prompt design is crucial and determines the quality of the output

### Gen AI on GCP quick tour
* clarification: consumers and entreprises have different needs: BARD and GPT are trained on the input data: specifically for consumers
* others are focussed on businesses
img03 - portfolio for cloud ai
* Vertex AI (as end to end ML platform) and foundation models
* all runs on cloud GPUs/TPUs
* todo test: generative AI app builder
* today: Gen AI Studio: rpototyping and testing models
  * image vision just for "truseted testers" - have to request access if interested TODO
  * Vertex model garden offers various entreprise user journeys
  * openAI access, usable for summarization, generation, ..
* generative ai app builder creates generative ai apps without writing any code
* also: enterprise search
* todo: google cloud console
### short intro
* jelena mjuskovic was first speaker
* create new pp: lots of UI as approach -> widget for my app where she can search through the content of google cloud -> source: website, unstructured data, structured data ->  then you gte the widget, which can be immediaely tested
* Duet AI coming soon: AI-powered collaborateur: looks like it is working for the user like copilot; needs developer preview program

## Responsible AI principes
img04
* be socially beneficial
* avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias
* be built and tested fot safety
* be accountable ..
* 16 safety filters, which can be defined for your use-case
* your data, your terms: data not shared with other users; model is frozen, not touched by promting and fine-tuning
