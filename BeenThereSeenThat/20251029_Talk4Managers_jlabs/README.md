# 20250929 Talk4Managers - j-labs

```
New initiative

You may know us under a different name - j-tech meetup. After 5 successful editions, we decided to merge with our new initiative: Talk4Managers, which we’ve already organized twice in Poland (with the third one on the way). As the name suggests, we’re shifting towards more business- and management-focused topics while still keeping the tech background in mind.

“With great change comes great responsibility”, paraphrasing slightly, and we stand by it. A new name, new colors, but the same people who hosted the very first event in Munich for just a dozen participants, and couldn’t fit nearly a hundred eager attendees one year later.

We’re excited to invite you once again to share knowledge, exchange experience, and enjoy inspiring conversations over a drink. See you there!

How to Empower Teams Across Generations

A research‑backed session on cross‑generational leadership—how Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, and Gen Z differ in work style, preferences, values, feedback norms, and career drivers, and what managers can do to spark leadership intent across generations.

---

Practical Productivity Tips for 2025

We will look at healthy productivity - how to offload a busy mind, protect focus, and get the right things done. All without losing clarity, spark, or humanity. What we want is less chaos and overwhelm, more calm, balance, and freedom. Let's look at ready-to-use strategies you can apply the same day - no hundred books, no complex systems, no hype.

## first talk
* joined at 18:30
* employees with managers more than 12 years older report 15x more likely low productivity
* these employees are 3x more likely to be extremely dissatisfied
* age gap is a good clue
* same employees are also more likely to be dissatisfied with their jobs
* but the opportunity is in age-diverse teams: with effective collaboration they can produce 41% more results

### how to do this?
* imagine an employee with IQ 120
* team of four 120 IQ people: IQ will drop — many psychological studies
* main causes: groupthink, echo chambers, solidified traditions and rigidity inside the team
* how to raise the IQ? to like 130 and more? 50% of team intelligence is based on the interaction between the members, not just who they are
* how to hack this?
* conclusion: diversity — if the team is diverse, there is a chance to break those communication patterns
  * maybe do gender diversity; does things better
  * or add age — different generations together
  * third option is culture: different backgrounds
* how much can be gained? 10% increase in age diversity = 3.5% productivity gain per year
* cost-benefit ratio for age-diverse teams
* individual performance declines with age, but for companies it has positive effects

### 5 ways to utilize generational diversity
* a modern fintech team might need Gen Z's rapid prototyping, digital fluency for quick prototyping
* Millennials with breaking matrix structures, Gen X robust build quality and risk management (make things work)
* a Baby Boomer is perfect to handle auditors; perfect process knowledge and understanding

#### customer connection
* when the organisation's generational age composition mirrors the customer base: then 33% growth in customer satisfaction compared to competitors
* UX: fast access button — Gen X did not notice, Gen Z used all functions through that interface

* reciprocal adjustment: 47% fewer generational conflicts, 38% higher cross-generational collaboration
* thinking-style-based ideation: Thinking Hats method, Belbin method, ... <-- check: Belkin?

  * this has been crossed out across the generations <-- check: clarify "crossed out"?

## take aways
* recognize your generational context
* specialize your approach towards 4 (soon 5) generations
* lubricate potential frictions

* but what if this is not sufficient? with current fertility rates, there is a prognosed decline. shall we adopt AI?
  * the AI twist
* slides? ittd.space

* audience opinions: he sees a trend of team leading by very early career people, where the team is older — does the research say something?
  * the 12-year gap goes plus and minus
* Gen Z and Gen Alpha? start own business, be own boss; Gen Alpha = born after 2010
* diverse teams have to question the status quo and are therefore more productive

## second talk
* Piotr tries to share productivity hacks and techniques
* there is no education about this: good luck
* study with the smartest minds
* what is productivity? crucial skill — time travel
* fighting balance — practical steps?
* Q&A — talk for two weeks and still not cover everything
* what does actually work: *Deep Work* book, 300 pages — then it breaks in ten minutes

* the feeling that we're pushing forward something important
* being excited about what we're doing
* being appreciated and admired
* leaving work and having time for ourselves

--
* constant changes and shifts, being caught
* regular workers
* constant change, shifts in direction
* being caught between employees and upper management
* unclear boundaries and expectations
* information overload
* typical managers are not atypical, but they maybe feel a bit less
* challenges: silo mentality; mindset; cultural change; resistance to digitalization and use of AI; AI misuse; context switching
* balancing meetings and real work — a good one

--
* productivity is value divided by effort
* effort can be time, energy, or money. sometimes these can be exchanged
* and what is value? value of one day or a year — shift in what matters
* 5 min of what he says will get 85% for us — maybe just one slide
* 21st century: you always have more to do than you can manage — this time is over
* how to do everything VS what is the most important? 230-year-old mentality vs now
* knowledge was limited, we collected it; now we have too much information — reverse of the problem
* how not to spend the same energy twice: see mail again — lose the same energy twice; collecting energy to not do this
* automate, Make, Zapier: build tons of very simple one-step automations, which do the job for you in a very simple way
* he talked to phone, then has the note in some other app as transcription — good
* he went from engineering to teaching 10 years ago:
  * experience → reflection (out of glucose and oxygen, or being miserable), this will lead to different knowledge → study and experiment — but in the 21st century this dies
  * the reflection part is gone — straight to the knowledge, so no experiment
  * everyone wants something which works from day one
  * Google Gemini: learning mode → provokes learning. Much deeper
  * how insulin affects focus? what pump moves lymph? <-- check: clarify or add context
  * 15 min per week to study your own body
  * improving sleep is the most important thing you can do for your productivity — but people want a supplement
  * in productivity space everyone has to find their own space
* now: skill of time travel
* sources of work: unplanned tasks; incoming communication; one is calendar; third is task list — move but not beyond deadline
* LSO leads to three different styles of communication <-- check: LSO?
* no book about this. and if you have a lot of unplanned work, the Pareto principle

## perspective when you get promoted
* now, today is the view — but this changes
* now: projects, strategy, values — the duration gets longer
* F1 car: 0 to 100 can accelerate in 1.8 seconds, with to zero then 4 seconds; but majority of people have no brakes
* 4 types of time: Goals; REST (how to recharge internal battery); relationships; creative time (explore what is possible) — AI is giving this time back to us — just check what an instrument can do
* building things just for fun may not fit
* energy levels fluctuate throughout your year
* average level of battery status is 55% — not the current charge, but the capacity (left): maybe improve this — because then it enables way more to do
* 44% of people wake up tired — "comment": so low

### practical steps to take
* slow down, experiment. 1 min between meetings
  * cold water, breathing exercise, a cat .. :3
* weekly summary — 15 min: tweak one thing every week; then after a year you have 50 tweaks
* clarity about: how do I organize my job?
* how to boost your batteries by 10%?
* experiment with prompts for emotions/metaphors/coaching: we have 24/7 access to coaching, so this can be continued whenever you want
* look for simple, everyday automations
* focused work blocks — Pomodoro technique — even 90 min, if you can allow this yourself

---

* layers: Pomodoro as level 1, organize life; then level 2: if you have kids then they have a predictable schedule; rhythm happens to be predictable, but not too boring; strategy as mirror
* only one good book about strategy — TODO ask him what this is, then switch to war-books
* try to reduce the cognitive load: remove stuff from life which does not matter
* improve sleep quality; improve breathing
* Wim Hof (Netherlands): cold baths; learning to breathe; overbreathers — muscles are tense
* recommend to increase light exposure
* CO2 levels: drop of 15% by 1000 ppm CO2 ((check what the proper unit is))
* experiment with ketogenic diet: did it improve the energy levels?
* active noise-cancelling headphones: less distraction from noise
* exercise
* get after 30 min of sitting our lymph to move
* but lying down for 5 min is also recommended — and do some breathwork

-----
* due to automations your brain is bombarded with tons of detailed data and reports; constant answers — and when you automate several things — started to feel more tired
* AUTOMATE TOO MUCH — this is a learning; don’t automate what you like
* if the automation creates more to process, then also a problem
* I need less cognitive load, not more
* hundreds of experiments which failed
* experimenting mindset
