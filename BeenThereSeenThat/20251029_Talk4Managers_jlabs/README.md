# 20250929 Talk4Managers - j-labs

```
New initiative

You may know us under a different name - j-tech meetup. After 5 successful editions, we decided to merge with our new initiative: Talk4Managers, which we’ve already organized twice in Poland (with the third one on the way). As the name suggests, we’re shifting towards more business- and management-focused topics while still keeping the tech background in mind.

“With great change comes great responsibility”, paraphrasing slightly, and we stand by it. A new name, new colors, but the same people who hosted the very first event in Munich for just a dozen participants, and couldn’t fit nearly a hundred eager attendees one year later.

We’re excited to invite you once again to share knowledge, exchange experience, and enjoy inspiring conversations over a drink. See you there!

Practical Productivity Tips for 2025

We will look at healthy productivity - how to offload a busy mind, protect focus, and get the right things done. All without losing clarity, spark, or humanity. What we want is less chaos and overwhelm, more calm, balance, and freedom. Let's look at ready-to-use strategies you can apply the same day - no hundred books, no complex systems, no hype.
