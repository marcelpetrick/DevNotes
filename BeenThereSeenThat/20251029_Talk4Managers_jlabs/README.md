# 20250929 Talk4Managers - j-labs

```
New initiative

You may know us under a different name - j-tech meetup. After 5 successful editions, we decided to merge with our new initiative: Talk4Managers, which we’ve already organized twice in Poland (with the third one on the way). As the name suggests, we’re shifting towards more business- and management-focused topics while still keeping the tech background in mind.

“With great change comes great responsibility”, paraphrasing slightly, and we stand by it. A new name, new colors, but the same people who hosted the very first event in Munich for just a dozen participants, and couldn’t fit nearly a hundred eager attendees one year later.

We’re excited to invite you once again to share knowledge, exchange experience, and enjoy inspiring conversations over a drink. See you there!

Practical Productivity Tips for 2025

We will look at healthy productivity - how to offload a busy mind, protect focus, and get the right things done. All without losing clarity, spark, or humanity. What we want is less chaos and overwhelm, more calm, balance, and freedom. Let's look at ready-to-use strategies you can apply the same day - no hundred books, no complex systems, no hype.

* age gap is a good clue
* same employees are also more likely tob e dissaisfied withtheir jobs
* but the opportunity is in age diverse teams: with effective collaboration they can produce 41% more results

### how to do this?
* imagine a employee of 120
* team of four 120 iq people. iq will drop. many psycological studies
* main causes: group think, echo chambers, solidified tradtions and rigidity inside the team
* how to raise the iq? to like 130 and more? 50&of team intelligence are based on the interaction between the members, not just how they are?
* how to hack this?
* conlsuion: diversity, if the team s diverse, there is a chance to break those communication patterns
  * maybe do gender diversity; does tings better
  * or add age diferent generations together
  * thirds options is culture: differnet backgrounds
* how much can be gained? 10% increase age diversity, 3,5% productivity gain per year
* cost ebenfit ratio for age diverse teams
* indvidual performance declines with qge, but for companies it has positive effects

### 5 ways to utilize generational diversity
* a modern fintech team might need gen'z rapid protodping digitalfleny for quick prototping
* milendials with breaking matri strsuctures, genX robutst build quality and risk managent (make things work)
* a baby boomer is perfect to handle auditros; perfect process knowledge and understanding

#### customer connection
* when the organisation generationa age composition mirrors the customer base: then 33% growth in customer satisfaction compared to competitors
* ux: fast access button; genx did not notice, genz used all functions throught that interface

* reciprocal adjustment: 47% fee generatinal conflits, 38% hgierh cross generational collaboration
* thinking style based ideation: thinking caps method, belkin method, ..)
  * this has been crossed aout across the genration

## take aways

  * the AI twist
* slides? ittd.space


* audience opinions: he sees a trend of teamleading of really early people, where the team is older: does the research saa something?
  * the 12 year gap goes plus and minus
* genZ and gen-alpha? start my own business, ne my own boss  ; gen-alpha born after 2010
