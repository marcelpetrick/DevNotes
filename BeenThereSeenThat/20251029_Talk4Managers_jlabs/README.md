# 20250929 Talk4Managers - j-labs

```
New initiative

You may know us under a different name - j-tech meetup. After 5 successful editions, we decided to merge with our new initiative: Talk4Managers, which we’ve already organized twice in Poland (with the third one on the way). As the name suggests, we’re shifting towards more business- and management-focused topics while still keeping the tech background in mind.

“With great change comes great responsibility”, paraphrasing slightly, and we stand by it. A new name, new colors, but the same people who hosted the very first event in Munich for just a dozen participants, and couldn’t fit nearly a hundred eager attendees one year later.

We’re excited to invite you once again to share knowledge, exchange experience, and enjoy inspiring conversations over a drink. See you there!

How to Empower Teams Across Generations

A research‑backed session on cross‑generational leadership—how Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, and Gen Z differ in work style, preferences, values, feedback norms, and career drivers, and what managers can do to spark leadership intent across generations.

Practical Productivity Tips for 2025

We will look at healthy productivity - how to offload a busy mind, protect focus, and get the right things done. All without losing clarity, spark, or humanity. What we want is less chaos and overwhelm, more calm, balance, and freedom. Let's look at ready-to-use strategies you can apply the same day - no hundred books, no complex systems, no hype.

## first talk
* joined at 1830
* employees with managers more than 12 years older report more likels low productivity, 15x
* tehse employees re 3x more likely to be extremely dssatisfied
* age gap is a good clue
* same employees are also more likely tob e dissaisfied withtheir jobs
* but the opportunity is in age diverse teams: with effective collaboration they can produce 41% more results

### how to do this?
* imagine a employee of 120
* team of four 120 iq people. iq will drop. many psycological studies
* main causes: group think, echo chambers, solidified tradtions and rigidity inside the team
* how to raise the iq? to like 130 and more? 50&of team intelligence are based on the interaction between the members, not just how they are?
* how to hack this?
* conlsuion: diversity, if the team s diverse, there is a chance to break those communication patterns
  * maybe do gender diversity; does tings better
  * or add age diferent generations together
  * thirds options is culture: differnet backgrounds
* how much can be gained? 10% increase age diversity, 3,5% productivity gain per year
* cost ebenfit ratio for age diverse teams
* indvidual performance declines with qge, but for companies it has positive effects

### 5 ways to utilize generational diversity
* a modern fintech team might need gen'z rapid protodping digitalfleny for quick prototping
* milendials with breaking matri strsuctures, genX robutst build quality and risk managent (make things work)
* a baby boomer is perfect to handle auditros; perfect process knowledge and understanding

#### customer connection
* when the organisation generationa age composition mirrors the customer base: then 33% growth in customer satisfaction compared to competitors
* ux: fast access button; genx did not notice, genz used all functions throught that interface

* reciprocal adjustment: 47% fee generatinal conflits, 38% hgierh cross generational collaboration
* thinking style based ideation: thinking caps method, belkin method, ..)
  * this has been crossed aout across the genration

## take aways
* recognize your generational context
* specialize your approach towards 4 (soon5) generations
* lubricate potential frictions

* but what if this is not sufficient? with current fertility rates, there is a progrnosed decline. shal we adopt AI?
  * the AI twist
* slides? ittd.space


* audience opinions: he sees a trend of teamleading of really early people, where the team is older: does the research saa something?
  * the 12 year gap goes plus and minus
* genZ and gen-alpha? start my own business, ne my own boss  ; gen-alpha born after 2010
* disverse teams have to question the stauts quo and are therefore more productive

## second talk
* piotr tries to share prodcictivy hacks.. techniques
* there is no education about this: goid luck
* study witht he smartest minds
* what is productvity? crucial skil - time travel
* fighting balance - practical steps?
* Q&A - talk for two weeks, but still not cover everything
* what does actually work: deep work book, 300 pages, then it braks in ten minutes

* the feeling that we're pushing forward something important
* being excited about what were doing
* being appreciated and admire
* levingg work and hanving time for ourself
--
* constant changes and shifts, being caught
* regular workers
* constant chnage, shifts in direction
* being caught between empliyees and upper managemrnt
* unclear boundaries and expectations
* information overlad
* typical managera are not axtpical, but they maybe feel a bit less
* challenges: silo mentality; mindset, culturual change; resistance to digitauation, and use of ai, ai misuse, context switcing
* blaancing meetings and real work; a good one
--
* productivty is value divided by effort
* effort can be time, energy or money. sometimes this can be exchanged
* and what is value? value of one day or a year; shift in what matters
* 5 min of what he says will get 85% for us; maybe just one slide
* 21st centur: you always have more to do than you can manage - this time is over
* how to do everything VS what is the most important? 230 year old mentality; versus now
* knowledge was limited, we collected this; now we have too much information; reverse of the problem
* how not to spend the sam energy twice: see mail again - lose the same energy twice; collecting energy to not to do this
* automate, make, zapier: build tons of very simple one step automations, who doe the job for you in a very simple way
* he talked tophone, then has the note in some other app as transcription ... good
* he went from engineering to teaching 10y ago:
  *experience -> reflection (out of glucose and oxygen, or being miseralbe), this willget to differnt knowledge -> study and experiment - but in 21st centur this dies
  * the reflection part is gone; right straight to the knowldge; so no experiment
  * everyone wants something whichworks from day one
  * google gemini: learning mode -> provokes learning. much deeper.
  * how insulin affets focus? what pump does lymph have mvoement
  * 15 min per week, to study your own body
  * improve sleep is the most important you can do for your prodcutivity - but people want a supplement
  * in productivity space everxrone has to find their own space
* now: skill of time travel
* sources of work: unplanned tasks; ingoing communication; one is calnder; thrid is task list - move but not beyond eadline
* LSO LEADS TO thre differnt styles of communication
* no book about this. and if you have a lot of unpanned work, the pareto principle

## perspective when you get promoted
* now, the today is the view - but this changes
* now; projets, strategy; values - the duration gets longer
* F1 car: 0 to 100 can acceleratein 1.8 second, with to zero then 4 s.; but majorit people have no break
* 4 types of time: Goals; REST (how to recharge internal batery); relationships; creative time (explore what is possible) - ai is giving this time back to us - just check what an instrument can do
* buidling things ust for fun may not fit
* energy levels fluctuate throughout your year
* average level of battery status is 55%. not the current charge, but the capcity (left): maybe improve this. because then it enable way more to do
* 44% of people wake up tired - "comment": so low

### practival steps to take
* slow down experiemnt. 1 min: between meetings
  * cold water, breathing exerciese, a cat .. :3
* weekly summary 15 min: tweak one thign every week; then after a year you have 50 tweaks
* clarity about: how do i organize my job?
* how to boost your batters by 10%? 
* experiment with prompts for emoptions/metaphors/coaching: we have 24/7 access to coaching; so this can be continued whenever you want?
* look fr simple, everyday automations
* focussed work blocks - pomodoro technique - even 90mins, if you can allow this yourself
