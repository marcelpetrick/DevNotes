    Are you looking to accelerate your IoT product development time and want to quickly build a connected solution in just few weeks?

    In this workshop, you will get hands-on experience and explore how to securely connect IoT products and manage them with AWS IoT services. Using a purpose-built educational device, the Demo Badge, you will learn about different AWS IoT connectivity options, including the MQTT protocol on AWS IoT Core and Bluetooth Low Energy on the Amazon Sidewalk network. This workshop also introduces you to use cases, such as, over-the-air updates, sensor data ingestion, geo-location lookup, digital twins and shadows, and low-power connectivity.

        Connecting IoT devices using MQTT to AWS Cloud
        Security, Certificates, device onboarding using AWS IoT ExpressLink
        OTA Updates
        Sensor Data Ingestion using Amazon Timestream and Grafana
        Device control and digital twins with mobile app integration

    Who should attend?
        Hardware and platform developers who need to enable ‘connectivity’ technologies in their design
        Firmware engineers who want to onboard a connected solution to the cloud with just few lines of code

    Giveaway
        The Demo device will be provided to each attendee to take with them and practice at your own pace
        The attendee will be able to reuse the Demo Badge for connecting to AWS IoT and conducting proofs-of-concept
