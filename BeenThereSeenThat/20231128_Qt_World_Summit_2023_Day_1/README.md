----------------

kate gregory - am.i a good.programmer
wants to be a good programmer

people.fulled with doubt and worry
payingher since 1979 to write code. says nothing aboutntoday
not arcitect, manager, cbersecurity, not a good person or not
but typing code does what sou habe planned for tld o
pipes dont leak , table sturdy for table
dnd people..lawful.good, lawful.evil
nut about capable or competent
or about great
worst person in theroomsthinks they are the best person in room
dunning kruger skills
being good causes you to not evaluate well
if you cant tell you are sucxessfully sining a note
but id asked to throw baseball.
misestimates skill yb largest round. the worst
if you think you are a 8. then maybe 7,8,9 or 10
for self assessments
people thunkt hey are great when they are awfzl..also awful.when thry are great
everyone got the same sozed hubnle, but different ones. this is how trams work
in order to learn do something you did jot know jow to donit
their little faces light up for learning
learnwith joy and eleight and pride
good tutorial, teaxher, framework,..
being uncomfortable does not.meanèµ°are learning
learning and growing: the more you learna dn know, the more you know you habe to learn
is wondering actually enough?
bad programmers exist
just wantin to be good does not make.you good
same peolle wil.do better in a different job
green bathroom.tile not a good metric
not any meaningful.way of self.evalution
non metrics: github records, who hired you, time.as a independant, 
the mere passage of time.does prove anything, some.things can be used as proxies
#how can you know?
a test.by three.questions: do.other people.ask your advicr, do you enjoy it, have you avoided the most outrageous catstrophes?
outrageous catastrophr for developrr:
problem produxtion - no
realizing afzer motnhs of work thwt a baic assumptionndoes jot hold
creating something unmaintainable.to.thwt nobody wanta to touch it
failing to consider.to test something vital (security, scaling, ..)
others ask you advice; did thy apply.it?
people.fillow your twitter or blog, ..
the real.key: enkoying it, do you like writing code?
does this person enjoy programming? second part: doing it in theirnfreee time? would you even donitnwhen you won the lottery?
* emotions in code?

----------------

data proxessing
2.8 gbyte/s 160 ms.e to e delay
identifying the right partnerships.is key
qt quick good.to hit the ground running good, also convenient
mix.of qt3d and opengl
want to.bzild the futrue.of cardio imaging
direct transfer betwern the 3 gpu. share textures. get everythingnreally.effixiently to screen

----------------

markomklementti , eficode - dev ops pipeline
strongpoint for ci/cd
strramluning the devopsnpieline
    1. agile feedbakc loops: conways law..complicated architectures for compicated comapines: team.topoligies lead to.buildinf services as api: selforgsnized teams are allowed to rrleaee more.often
    2.creating new embedded products is jot synchronized: software and hardware.meet on thr same.maturity levels. then ship, butssw  xontinues to imrpive
    3.build.autonation and traceability: ci is perfect plave to collect sbom
    4.
security shift left
5..cognitive load.for developers. team tpology, platform.topolyg, ficus on the core business
6..measuring success
dora devops metrics often fall short
mean time.to.recober deployment frequency
change filure rate
lead.time.for.a.releaee.candidate - else you keep theorganization slow
automated test coverage
cost of delay
ratio of.modular dependencies

----------------

qt will.continue to support steongly cross platform
os versions release and qt timeline for feature freeze have thrmnin mind
qt6 for direct hardware platform.support
multimidal.user interfacws..multiple.users in the ame application..speehninterfaces.
twxt to speech api, speech recognitionnisnsalso.researched

qt6 and RHI: efficient inzegration eith openxr
qt quick 3d..create 3d scenes with qml.and js
create more.in less time!
ready made solutions, from.ui to neteork
high level kodules for visualizing data
not want to reinvent the wheel
integrwtion to 3rd party solutions like.ooencv, tensorflow, authentication frameworks
connevred first. gRPC, MqTt, coapp, http, qt remote objects, opc UA
cBwr secueity..eu resilience act,.usa.cBersecuritx act..for connected evices. guidelines for qt, dor things which could be problematic..also.for.conpliiance
four eye oricniocle for evwry commit..at least reviewed by someone else..anybody can contribute, but wvrything is reviewed..also runs though the CI
also fuzz testing fot things whichnhandle untrusted data, hardening those intefaves
if there are CVEs. they will be analyzed, the maintainers are informed, then disclosed
language wise security: cpp committee, makr the language more secuee and safer to use
language development cpp20 or cpp23, also for rust and python
qt6 as cpp17.requirement
tension between.on the edge developers, and regulated areas
questions:
qt qml.or widgets? qt wuicj as first class technology. highlyndeclarwtive, designer friendly, hwrswsre acxellerwted. but qt focuess on qt quick.
printingnto the qtpdf module?
peoblem eith qt macros and the cpp23 modules
whole. rat tail of things to handle for new widgets. cross platform, ...
effective. css supporz in wt widgets
but can be comoute heavy. after prototyping review
efficient: implment own style

change i was afraid of that - kevin henney

even english alnguages changes, just lacks the version number
sandman neil gaiman - brief lives
how do you know time is hapoening? change
humans are allergic to change, grace hopper
aechitectuee reprwenrs the significant desing decisions thwt shape.the form.and rhe function a system - grady booch
a view of the architecure. not.the architecruee. 
drawing air is architecture. because not a small.change
measuremnrts ib costs, time and pain
â€œcpp developers are unique in their tolerance to painâ€œ ðŸ¤£
97 thungs evrysoftware architecture should know
simplicity before genrrality
a4chitecure changes. scales to.humans
half life of code quite high. see winxp
code has no.decay. does not rot. 
maintenance is fixing wear ant ear. not fiying bugs. this has been there always. perform an ootimization
look at it from a higger context. do it with focus.
definitikn of focus. ignode everything else
features ar emode ofnstfwar.e software modr of code. so comoany suceces is based on code. therefoee they should focus else they lose money
managingndebt..total control. not intrinsically a problem.
unmanaged debtm.thats theprovlem.
the handling of the debt is the question.
technical neglect
cant pint to the abscene of change. just pointing to the chnage is possible
dependency steucture for security
## issues:
not refactoring before change. big problem..prepare the space!
not refactoring change.
not testing. aboid breaking peoples assumptions.
not reviweing code.
not recoeding decisions.
not revisiting decisions.
not updating technology. to draw from a large portion of the population. and chatgpt has been trained up on.

from code to influence - jonathan courtois
* how to becoke a leader without becoming a manager
* aince 2010 freelance developer, studied many diffenrt industry sectors
* tech lead, architect, solver, right hand: see photo
* does the title.matter: yes..because it will.give you credibility, unlocks you the room, comoensation boost, role teansition, confery autbority, but lasting inoact is derived from aproach an skill
* strategies for success: operating at the staff level
* learning curve: slow feedback loop, strategix work over instantious gratifixatiin of coding
* prioritze your impact
* strategy crafting
mentoship and growth, shift focus from.orovubg personal capabilotx to empowering and geowing rhe team
diverse networking: talk to people inside the company learn from.the departments
recommendation lead dev.com good starting ooint. 4. to 5.12..2023.
also.teo.book recooemndations
slack channel for free as well
todo check leaddev
check his linkedin

qt academy
before missing bigger picture..18 months
put.limited amoubtof content and made some.prototype. would it work? surpassed the expectations. in 4.onths results..wrnt all.in
badges, can do eebinars, also.partner content
scythe studio and kdab added content as well
toso: check the qt cmqke course 
sponsored learning path?
more pedagocial.understanding
also: working eith real.life examples

why do you see a career in teh worth pursuing.
mathrmsticians, prigeammers, coders ctos

the ceo of FYI

if you want to.solve problems on the highest level..aply.yourself.to the language, coding or protocol

dreamers,ideators have the task.to.do great things

is.sodtware.making the luves of developers easier?

genai
kevlin: you made youeself a legacy maintainrr. because you have not lead the devdlopment, unknown defects are hidden
not good.cuktuee to vreate good tools.for developers
observe how developers use.git?
is it designed as a consunable product?

people.are doing things they can check..emials, write.text, convwrt code..good uae xases.because check ablr

but what about taking code from.stack oveflow and then xonvert into unknown language, no clue how to Debug. dangerous

can we.check the rsult..do.we habe enough time.to.check the result?

discussuon rotated much around the usage of genrrwtive ai.

and accountability.
gwt better by repetition..by ubdersranding. once you habedone you can automste.the stuff

no genrations of  who used genAi
you cant engineer yourself.out of a cuktural problem..volker

the tools.facilitate something.
