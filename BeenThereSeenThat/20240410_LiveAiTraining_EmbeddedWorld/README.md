    About
    Date: Wednesday April 10, 2024
    Start Time: 10:00 AM local Germany time
    Where: Nuremberg Messe, NCC Mitte, Munchen 2
    Duration: Three hours

    Attend this three-hour training session and walk away with the latest hardware and software to serve as the foundation of your Edge AI application development. Work with AI-native compute solutions and be among the first developers to use the Synaptics Astra™ Developer Kit, which offers you a chance to get ahead of the curve in a classroom environment. You’ll be trained on the tools that enable real-world AI capabilities to be deployed on your IoT solutions.

    By the end of the workshop, you’ll understand that developing and working with AI-enable machine vision applications do not have to be overly complex. The workshop will focus on inferencing using SyNAP™, a proven and secure neural network development and optimization framework that is foundational to Synaptics Astra, the AI-native compute platform for the IoT.

    Giveaway
    Sponsored by Synaptics, each attendee will receive a Synaptics Astra™ Developer Kit to keep, along with all the associated software, libraries, and algorithms, and live hands-on training that’s required to implement an AI use-case (total value of hardware and software is approximately $2000).

    Cost to attend: $30US (approximately 27 Euros)

```

* Windows user shall use WSL and then install any Ubuntu
* second option: or a true virtual machine, virtual box
* unwrapped the board and set up everything, including wifi
* Rich Nass gave the introduction

* Adel Younes and Lorenzo, located in Lausanne
* Astra platform
* `really excited to be here` xD
*

# angeda
* worskhop goals
* snyaptic astra platform
*code repos overview: yocto linux, syNAP
* first hour long session is an overview with selected AI use cases
* hands on development
* quick pulse of te room: Qr-code, then office.forms
  * 71 beginner, 17 intermediate, rest advanced
  * most prefer linux over rtos and android and windows: 50% versus rest
  * major hurdles: proprietary software, and the SoC are not designed for AI, lack of standards only 17%
* they want to develop awareness about openSource toolkits
* get familiar with Edge AI workflow and pipeline stages
* how to promote more standards and best practices
* workflow: sense, process, connect
* 8 TOPS NPU machine for the Astra-SoC we got (wow)
* core board where additional board can be plugged in
* Synpatics SL1680; 4 cores ARM
* abstraction layers for the synaptics sdk: below RTOS, Linux, Android
* stong background for synpatics for AI: first finterprint, then pc trackpad palm prediction, then multi-modal capable SoC, to fleible platform nowadays
* what does Synpatics offer?
  * BYO data
  * BYO model
* BYO data
  * generate production modesl from snypatic refernece models
 * post training compiler optimizations
securely deploy with guaranteed highest performance metrics across portfolio

## How to install
* WSL2 with Ubutnu 22.04
* Docker
* SoC has already an image with basic wayland shell
* SocC has already some apps, like quad-video player
* video for linux api
* single object detection, dual obect, pose estimation (working out of box, more or less fluent - 15 fps?)
  * even running three video streams and doing pose estimation works without performance challenges
* for

## github
* https://github.com/synaptics-astra
* getting started guide
* also: Astra Yocto Linux User Guide; default image can be downloaded on github as well
* synpatics Astra SDK: not doing open development yet, but main branch and release 0.9.0 can be found
* also minimum number of layers to get an functional image
* `crops` as docker container - reproducible environment; clean environment for the whole org
* import the two tar.gz to docker ..
* import from TFLite, TesnorFlow, PyTorch, Caffee, ONNX is possible
* docker and python based tooling and process, enabling cross-platform support
* network graph and metadata generation for target NPU
* best is TFLite quantized
```
 1475  sudo docker load -i ../docker-images/synaptics-astra-crops-0.9.0.tgz\n

    /run/media/mpetrick/D241-940D/Workshop USB stick/docker-images 
```
* yolov5s model, face detection
  * generate out of that a synpa-file
* optimization by pruning and applying pre-processing steps for the training is possible
TODO add image of the slide
* syNAP Driver Architecture
* C++ application with 10 lines of code (ok, this has to be proven ..)?
* trusted execution environment: SyKure Truseted application
  * NPU is completely isolated into the secure environment
* what is heterogenous AI inference?

## Hands-on tutorial
* setup is running





## where do i start?
* go to these model repositories: ultralytics
* either use v5 or v8 for yolo; usual detection - pick the model (step1)
* yolov5 is flexible enough to recude the use-case only to faces: 80 class model
* TODO image for the hgh level workflow
* what to do first: install te toolkit
* runtime launches .synap file, delivering key benefits
  * graph-slitting, heterrogenous infering across NPU, CPU, GPU, DSP
  * qualtzation: mixed-precision, entropy optimized, per chnalle
  * pre-processing: input data format conversion on NPU
* SL1680/SL1640 functional block diagram
* PPU can run OpenCL oor OpenVL code
* PPU - ConvCore (NN) - Tensor processor (TP)
* ghcr - github contaner registry
* quanitzation: floating point arithmentic or integer; for maximum precision floating point is better, but interger is faster - especially 8 bit
  * then you have to refer to a typical dataset typical for your use-case
  * extract range of the floating point values, result is min and max integer
  * quatize to int8
### TODO
* how to use docker for the dvelopment workflow for c++?
* how to build own yocto/poky/bitbake?
  * how to add custom layers?

* took today less goodies, but more knowledge from the exhbition
