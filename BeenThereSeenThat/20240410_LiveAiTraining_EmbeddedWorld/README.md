    About
    Date: Wednesday April 10, 2024
    Start Time: 10:00 AM local Germany time
    Where: Nuremberg Messe, NCC Mitte, Munchen 2
    Duration: Three hours

    Attend this three-hour training session and walk away with the latest hardware and software to serve as the foundation of your Edge AI application development. Work with AI-native compute solutions and be among the first developers to use the Synaptics Astra™ Developer Kit, which offers you a chance to get ahead of the curve in a classroom environment. You’ll be trained on the tools that enable real-world AI capabilities to be deployed on your IoT solutions.

    By the end of the workshop, you’ll understand that developing and working with AI-enable machine vision applications do not have to be overly complex. The workshop will focus on inferencing using SyNAP™, a proven and secure neural network development and optimization framework that is foundational to Synaptics Astra, the AI-native compute platform for the IoT.

    Giveaway
    Sponsored by Synaptics, each attendee will receive a Synaptics Astra™ Developer Kit to keep, along with all the associated software, libraries, and algorithms, and live hands-on training that’s required to implement an AI use-case (total value of hardware and software is approximately $2000).

    Cost to attend: $30US (approximately 27 Euros)
