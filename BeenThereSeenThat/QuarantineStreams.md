## 20200803 PyQt5
https://youtu.be/Vde5SH8e1OQ - basic stuff  
https://youtu.be/-2uyzAqefyE - Buttons and Events (Signals)  
During the workout I wanted to see how tutorials introduce to PyQt. The guy did the videos quite well, but I could notice some flaws, which are maybe the result of lack of experience with Qt on C++. On the other hand: he did several video-tutorials and I didn't. So, kudos to him!

## 20200812 mucpp: Clare Macrae - Quickly and Effectively Testing Legacy C++ Code with Approval Tests
https://youtu.be/vtWnqqSUzrY - definitely a quicker way to cover more case without using more asserts.m Haven't finished the video (yet), but will defeinitely give it a try!
(CLion, code coverage, unit testing)

## 20200812 mucpp: Klaus Igelberger - Calling Functions: A Tutorial
TODO: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/709132681 - couldn't watch live, but I expect some insights. Last time I throught about function-calls was while we implemented a compiler at study times. Will be definitely not a guide to simply call a function xD

## 20201008 - Markus Klemm - C++ combined JavaScript for modern GUI development (C++ UG Dresden)
Just stream, no recording yet. His approach with NPM and Electron for the JS-Frontend was similar to what QML from Qt is.
Maybe will give it try.
