ABOUT THE TALK
We need good leadership. Badly. The usual approach to develop leadership is to send (prospective) leaders to a 1-week resort and pray. But this is far from ideal. Ever wondered how you can develop your own leader toolkit? Franziska will walk you through a model and give practical tips in her talk.

* IC doth not a good manager make
* * delegation without micromanagement
 * IC CAN feedback; manager must feedback
 * ICs are leaders

* usually companies do a 1-week-resort with some trainings and they expect to have perfect leaders with proper skillset: NOT GOOD
  * it can help to get some insights and hints to process, but usually not well received; we all have different learning types
  * developing means consistently learning and upskilling

* evertime she was faced with a bad leader (lack of investment or commitment): she said: everything but that
  * now she sues those moments to turn the ship around
* in other scenarios it means: asking yourself again what is currently needed to excel?
* what is a leadership profile
![](img04.png) - the chart
* there are different profiles; all things can be taken and improved
* good leaders have the ability to reflect and give feedback: observe people at any given moment
* open mindet; negotiation skill
* being a leader hurts: because you will notice that you are very biased and you have the ability to confront your bias
* consistently confront yourself about that bias
* not seeing yourself as the victim, but taking active charge
* strict decisions might also go against team members
