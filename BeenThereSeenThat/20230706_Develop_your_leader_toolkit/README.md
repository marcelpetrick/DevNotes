ABOUT THE TALK
We need good leadership. Badly. The usual approach to develop leadership is to send (prospective) leaders to a 1-week resort and pray. But this is far from ideal. Ever wondered how you can develop your own leader toolkit? Franziska will walk you through a model and give practical tips in her talk.
