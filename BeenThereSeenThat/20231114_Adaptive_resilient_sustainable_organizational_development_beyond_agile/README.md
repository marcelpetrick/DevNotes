Adaptive, resilient, sustainable: organizational development beyond agile

In our November online event we will be hosting Krishan Mathis and Martin Pfiffner, two organisational development experts, sharing their thoughts on the application of Viable System Model (VSM) on guiding transformations.

üéôÔ∏èSummary:
How the Viable System Model can help fix agile implementations.

Agile is becoming a commodity, and the Scaled Agile Framework has contributed significantly to this trend - and accelerated it. Companies stress that it benefits them to have consistent terms; in some industries, it has become a de facto standard.

But still, as it becomes more widespread, its limitations become more apparent. The framework is a rigid package and is most helpful when first introduced by a less experienced organization; on the other hand, the amount of techniques offered is difficult to manage. Some implementations are suboptimal or fail altogether.

Of course, experience helps, but that is not the point here. We want to point out which are blind spots of the framework, which aspects beyond Agile and Lean still need to be considered when designing an organization. We also want to introduce comprehensible tools to diagnose dysfunctionalities and design the concrete organization.

These tools go beyond Agile and come from the fields of organizational design and cybernetics. They can be harmoniously extend the agile approach and be offered in a scaled implementation of Agile and Lean.

Agenda:

    The adaptive and resilient organization: organizational development beyond Agile
    Decisions and information: the third dimension in corporate structure. Introduction to the Viable System Model
    Integration VSM and Scaled Agile: how do they fit together?
    Diagnosis and design: concrete practical examples of VSM application.

Speakers:
Krishan Mathis, Consultant, Thinker and Trainer, Founder at Radical Focus
Martin Pfiffner, Expert in Organizational Structures, Founder at MPC

* AgileUplift
* viable systems model

## Do we really need another framework?
* acceptance and new storming phase is needed
* lots of organizations have already a challenge to implement existing frameworks
* too many existing frameworks are already a challenge and miss their promise
* as new framework: is it vaiable and profitable enough?
