Connecting diverse people is core of what we're doing at AWS User Group Munich and so we couldn't ask for a better speaker line-up for the March event right after the International Women's Day (March 8th 2024)!

This time we meet at the AutoScout24 office and thankfully get food and drinks provided.

AGENDA:
18:30 - Doors open, networking, drinks, food

19:00 - Markus Ostertag (AWS Hero): Recent AWS announcements

20:00 - Sana Shah (Founder AWS Women's UG Berlin & Cloud Operations Lead @ DEMICON): GenAI on AWS - Exploring Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases and Agents

21:00 - Evelyn Osman & Anastasios Vomvylas (AutoScout24): Scaling k8s services based on custom metrics: From discovery to delivery

21:45 - More drinks, more networking
-----
If you have an office or co-working space where we can meet (100-150 people), want to sponsor drinks/food or have a (lightning) talk you want to present - please let us know!

Everyone who participates in an AWS UG Munich event must adhere to the Code of Conduct!
