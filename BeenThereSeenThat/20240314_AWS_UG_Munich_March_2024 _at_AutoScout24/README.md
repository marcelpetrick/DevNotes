# 20240314 AWS UG Munich March 2024 @ AutoScout24

```
Connecting diverse people is core of what we're doing at AWS User Group Munich and so we couldn't ask for a better speaker line-up for the March event right after the International Women's Day (March 8th 2024)!

This time we meet at the AutoScout24 office and thankfully get food and drinks provided.

AGENDA:
18:30 - Doors open, networking, drinks, food

19:00 - Markus Ostertag (AWS Hero): Recent AWS announcements

20:00 - Sana Shah (Founder AWS Women's UG Berlin & Cloud Operations Lead @ DEMICON): GenAI on AWS - Exploring Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases and Agents

21:00 - Evelyn Osman & Anastasios Vomvylas (AutoScout24): Scaling k8s services based on custom metrics: From discovery to delivery

21:45 - More drinks, more networking
-----
If you have an office or co-working space where we can meet (100-150 people), want to sponsor drinks/food or have a (lightning) talk you want to present - please let us know!

Everyone who participates in an AWS UG Munich event must adhere to the Code of Conduct!
```

## Markus Ostertag (AWS Hero): Recent AWS announcements
* if someone is interested, they shall talk to Maria from "talent acquisition - not HR"
* AWS backup restore testing: really cool feature: test the restore on a certain schedule
* Who uses .NET on Lambda: obviously nobody
* EventBridge API destinations calling 3rd party APIs in a nutshell
* Amazon Neptune: I/O optimized now GA - zero charges for read and write I/O operations -> potentially cost savings
* 99.999% durability - five-nine durability as spoken
* CloudFormation now 40% faster at stack creation
* AI/ML: Bedrock: Mistral AI foundation models now GA
  * Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet model now available

## Sana Shah (Founder AWS Women's UG Berlin & Cloud Operations Lead @ DEMICON): GenAI on AWS - Exploring Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases and Agents
* Special focus on: bias
* Cloud Operations Lead at Demicon; platform automation..
* Why GenAI is so effective; uses pretrained models; use it to increase productivity, automation, ..
* Traditional ML allows handling only one task on labelled data; but with FM you can adapt to several tasks with unlabelled data
* Building a FM (foundation model) bears challenges
  * Costs: very expensive
  * Clusters of GPU and CPU
  * Large amount of data: like internet-scale data
  * Performance is a problem: inaccurate, unreliable answers, hallucinations
* Challenge: biases and toxicity: without addressing these risks
* For the customization of FMs there are different options:
  * Prompt engineering
  * In-context learning? to optimize the output? <-- check: in-context learning
  * While picking a model, read the documentation: best way to interact with the model
  * Retrieval augmented generation
  * Continued pre-training: more expensive
  * Build your own model
* RAG mitigates the problem of lacking actual information; also can be used to use concurrent information

### GenAI applications on AWS
* Two approaches: Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart versus Amazon Bedrock
* ML hub with foundation models, built-in algorithms - versus a Service: fully managed service to build and scale generative AI application with FMs
* Amazon Bedrock really easy to use:
* Amazon Bedrock - a single API call
* Bedrock - build knowledge bases: fully managed support for end-to-end RAG workflow
* Securely connect FMs and agents to data sources
* Easily retrieve relevant data and augment prompts
* Provide source attributions
* Workflow: 1. data source -> 2. document chunks - 3. embeddings model -> 4. vector store
* Build agents with Amazon Bedrock
* Agent action group description, API schema, lambda function
* AMAZON BEDROCK - give it a try: ASAP!
* How to do augmentation: how to create a knowledge base?
  * So very easy to create a knowledge base; really easy to create something like this - also can attribute source!!!
* Cloud computing has 14% of women in the field; AI has 36%, engineering like 20%, according to the World Economic Forum

### Risks in GenAI - Bias
* Examples for bias in AI:
  * Amazon recruitment tool: gender bias
  * Google photo misclassification: racial bias
  * COMPAS recidivism prediction: racial bias
* Based on data: selection bias, measurement bias, sample bias, label bias, observer bias, historical bias
* Algorithmic bias: algorithm bias, model bias, interaction bias, confirmation bias

## Amazon SageMaker Clarify
* Will not mitigate bias, just create a report
* Shared responsibility model! Like always

## Conclusion
* Data is your differentiator - data strategy is key to any successful AI application
* Mitigating risk is your continued responsibility
* Costs, costs, costs, -> know ROI
* Availability of features in regions
* Keep learning + trial & error approach
* Keep staying informed about trends

## Evelyn Osman & Anastasios Vomvylas (AutoScout24): Scaling k8s services based on custom metrics: From discovery to delivery
* Not watched - left early
