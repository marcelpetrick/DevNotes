## intro to the event

* Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Lebenslanges Lernen: one of the guys
* CPSA certification of the Hannes Gerne
* plan is to do a kata to practice active software architecture

## intro to C4

* Ted Neward's Architecture Kata Rules (see image 03.png)

* container diagram: also shows the technoklogy decisions, how do the containers talk with each other?
* up to 12.png - the c4 model itself

## phase 1: requirements & quality goals

* ISO9126: as quality goals
* ADR: architecture decision record

## start of the group sessions in breakout rooms
* Tobi J.; Klaus B. Philip Schmidt als PO
* 20 min to read the kata and the requirements, and maybe we can create already some postits
* what is the goal to select as three quality goals? we choose something which has influence on the chosen architecture

### our goals
* portability (web solution for browser and phone, can be used also for guests in the lobby, also for telephone (if the hotel-workers use it))
* Usability
* Maintanability
--> our PO Philip Schmitt agrees to those goals
