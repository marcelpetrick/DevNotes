* Remi is at the Qt WS in Berlin: has a sample
* Witekio is an AVNET company

* MCUs can be easier to use and have unique advantages
* currently more and more MCUs, which offer high performance; sometimes easier to integrate (simplicity)

## why choose an MCU over a MPU
* real-time processing!
* low power consumption
* simpler thermal management
* instant boot time
* low BOM cost

* why Qt? cross-platform development
![](img03.png)
* homogenous UX across the devices; maintaining this across devices can be costly -> reuse of code
* GUI application prerequisits to migrate to MCUs
  * medium to low-resolution displays: 320x240 to 1280x720; with really high performance MCUs even more possible, but rare
  * no real-time 3D; pre-rendered stuff possible, also realtime 2.5D on some MCUs (2d objects in 3d space ..)

* QML language adapted for MCUs and ressource constrained systems
  * like Cortex M, R or equivalent, low-end MPUs..
## Qt Quick Ultralite
* less code with QML declarative language
* low memory requirements (200 KB RAM minimum)
* rendered with Monotype Spark
* library of stylable UI controles and 2D shapes
* extensive image format support and HW-accelleration support

## reusing Qt code across MCUs and MPUs
![](img05.png)
* can run for MCUs directly on the drivers; RTOS not mandatory

## real life examples
* Yangfen Visteon: Automotive Tier 1 supplier from China; cost reduction by moving towards MCUs
* Hasselblad: 3 displays; one was already using a MPU, but wanted another one for the new third display
