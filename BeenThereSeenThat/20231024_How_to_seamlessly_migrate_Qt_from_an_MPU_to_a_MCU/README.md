* Remi is at the Qt WS in Berlin: has a sample with him
* Witekio is an AVNET company

* MCUs can be easier to use and offer unique advantages.
* Currently, there are increasingly more MCUs which offer high performance; they are sometimes easier to integrate due to their simplicity.

## Why choose an MCU over an MPU
* Real-time processing
* Low power consumption
* Simpler thermal management
* Instant boot time
* Low BOM cost

* Why choose Qt? Cross-platform development
![](img03.png)
* Homogeneous UX across devices; maintaining this uniformity across devices can be costly -> hence the reuse of code.
* GUI application prerequisites to migrate to MCUs:
  * Medium to low-resolution displays: 320x240 to 1280x720; with high-performance MCUs even higher resolutions are possible, though rare.
  * No real-time 3D; pre-rendered graphics are possible, as well as real-time 2.5D on some MCUs (2D objects in a 3D space).

* QML language is adapted for MCUs and resource-constrained systems:
  * Like Cortex M, R, or equivalent, low-end MPUs.

## Qt Quick Ultralite
* Write less code with the QML declarative language.
* Low memory requirements (200 KB RAM minimum).
* Rendered with Monotype Spark.
* Library of stylable UI controls and 2D shapes.
* Extensive image format support and HW-acceleration support.

## Reusing Qt code across MCUs and MPUs
![](img05.png)
* Can run for MCUs directly on the drivers; RTOS not mandatory.

## Real-life examples
* Yangfen Visteon: Automotive Tier 1 supplier from China; achieved cost reduction by transitioning to MCUs.
* Hasselblad: 3 displays; one was already using an MPU, but a switch was made for the new third display.

## Remi: Migrating Qt from MPU to MCUs
* Either you have someone familiar with the MPU world, but there's still much to learn about MCUs.
![](img06.png)
* PTSD from strange experiences.
![](img07.png)
* The team had previously no knowledge about the MCU world; it was seen as outdated.
* The main question was: what can be transferred from the existing skills?
* Reused the coffee-machine-example from Qt 6.6 to QtForMcu 2.5: it's a simple QML based application without a C++ backend.
![](img08.png)
* Just a copy-paste of the QQuick application to the Qul app - with some adaptations. <-- check: Elaborate on what adaptations were made?
* Note: the sugar cube isn't rotated; the font is also different; sliders lack customization (new stylesheet needed).
* My question: `Regarding these styling issues, does the toolchain for Qul generate any warnings? Both during build and at runtime?`
![](img09.png)
* Most features are present; if not, re-implementation didn't take much time.
![](img10.png)
* The need for C++ singletons has been simplified: see the `charging station` example.

### Custom control creation

* The MPU uses a standard linear gradient, which is replicated in MCU using the Painted QUL Monotype.

## How to write code for MCU?
* Most of the QUL types are available in QML.
![](img22?.png)
![](img23?.png)
* Transitioning from the MPU world and writing in QUL isn't straightforward.
* A mechanism for dynamic item creation must be established to prevent having dozens of views loaded simultaneously.
* Be cautious with image resources.
* Everything that was planned could be implemented, though some trial and error were necessary.
* The documentation is thorough.

* Using one codebase for both platforms is feasible nowadays, but it shouldn't be mixed with desktop deployments.
