---------------------------

* Remi is at the Qt WS in Berlin: has a sample
* Witekio is an AVNET company

* MCUs can be easier to use and have unique advantages
* currently more and more MCUs, which offer high performance; sometimes easier to integrate (simplicity)

## why choose an MCU over a MPU
* real-time processing!
* low power consumption
* simpler thermal management
* instant boot time
* low BOM cost

* why Qt? cross-platform development
![](img03.png)
* homogenous UX across the devices; maintaining this across devices can be costly -> reuse of code
* GUI application prerequisits to migrate to MCUs
  * medium to low-resolution displays: 320x240 to 1280x720; with really high performance MCUs even more possible, but rare
  * no real-time 3D; pre-rendered stuff possible, also realtime 2.5D on some MCUs (2d objects in 3d space ..)
![](img04.png)
* QML language adapted for MCUs and ressource constrained systems
  * like Cortex M, R or equivalent, low-end MPUs..
## Qt Quick Ultralite
* less code with QML declarative language
* low memory requirements (200 KB RAM minimum)
* rendered with Monotype Spark
* library of stylable UI controles and 2D shapes
* extensive image format support and HW-accelleration support

## reusing Qt code across MCUs and MPUs
![](img05.png)
* can run for MCUs directly on the drivers; RTOS not mandatory

## real life examples
* Yangfen Visteon: Automotive Tier 1 supplier from China; cost reduction by moving towards MCUs
* Hasselblad: 3 displays; one was already using a MPU, but wanted another one for the new third display

## Remi: migrating Qt from MPU to MCUs* 
* either you take someone coming from the MPU world MUC, but still much to know at once
![](img06.png)
* PTSD from strange experiences
![](img07.png)
* team had before no knowledge about the MCU world: MCU world seen as something old
* question was: what can be transferred from existing skills?
* reuse of the coffee-machine-example from Qt 6.6 -> QtForMcu 2.5: is a simple QML based application, no C++ backend
![](img08.png)
* just copy paste of the QQuick application to the Qul app - and some adaptation (what adaptation?)
* note: sugar cube not rotated; font is also different; sliders lack customization (new stylesheet)
* my question: `Those styling-issues: does the toolchain for Qul generate any warnings? Build-/runtime ones?`
![](img09.png)
* most features are present - even if not: re-implementation did take not much time
![](img10.png)
* necessity of C++ singletones  has been simplified: see example `charging station`

TODO add screenshots

### custom control creation
![](img20?.png)
* MPU has standard linear gradient -> done in MCU by using the Painted QUL Monotype
![](img21?.png)

## How to write code for MCU?
* most of the QUL types are available in QML
![](img22?.png)
![](img23?.png)
* coming from MPU world and writing QUL is not straight forward
* a mechanism of dynamic item creation must be put in place to prevent having dozen of views simultaneously loaded
* beware of image resources
* everything could be implemented, what was planned - some trial&error had to be applied
* documentation are thorough

* one codebase for both platforms should be possible nowadays, but not mixing with desktop-deployments
