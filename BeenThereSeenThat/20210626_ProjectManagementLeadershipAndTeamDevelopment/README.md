[break] until 1040
* 1. Leadership - Motivating Vision: create a motivating vision
* it is important to understand the motivation of other people
     * easier to inspire them to support the project goal
     * when needed extrinsic motivation can be used
     * but rather work on the intrinsic motivation
* motivation factors change over time Generation XYZ are less  motivated by rules and clear vision; more by enjoyment and work-life-balance
* this means that the leadership approach needs to change

Motivation: official term
* direction, intensitiv and endurance  of the willingness to move towards or away from a targt
* there is ex- an intrinsic motivation
* oftne MOTIVES as basis for motivation; single, isolated reasons for human willingness to behave in a certain way
* NEED: more likely related to the lack of something
[insert Steva Jobs quote ..]
  # 1. Intrinsic motivation
* ![](01.png)
* curiosity, challenge, control, recognition, cooperation, competition, fantasy
* has to be satisfying and imaginable
* ![](02.png)
# 2. Extrinsic motivation
* gain a specific reward or steer clear of punishment
* reward: bonus, salary, promotion
* fear: don't want to lose your job
[task: group activities]
![](04.png)
* TODO: what does motivate you?
* what was missing as motivation?
* how to add that little sparkle of motivation yourself to make the day a good day?
### Maslow's hierarchy of needs
![](05.png)* humang being is a group being: wants to be part of a group, sports team, friends, any other group* Maslow says that you have to finish one layer before you can ove up; later refined to "work on different layers at the same point of time"
* You cannot motivate anybody to do something he does not want to do.; but if you mange to revive intrinsic motivation - for example by fun and play - then you will be successful
* example: chalk number on the floor; factory; 5, then 6 ..
![](06.png)
* Transcendence (like: improve the world)
![](07.png)
* Maslow's pyramid adjusted for employee commitment
###  Herzberg's Motivation Hygiene
![](08.png)
### McClelland ned theory
* need for achievement: give challenging tasks; give feedback
* ned for power: maintaining the leader-follower-relations
* neeed for affiliation: want to be accepted, have group feeling, other employees are highly motivated for them; often conform to the wishes of colleagues; tipp: they look for people; helpful for organising for team meetings 
![](09.png)
[break] until 1145
## Leadership
* get extraordinary achievement from ordinary people; Brian Tracy
* "An army of sheep led by a lion beats an army of lions led by a sheep" Arabic proverb
* ability of group or individuals to influence and guide other members of an organisation
* bad leadership: shouting, asking for the impossible; good: having a clear vision where to go
## responsibility of a leader: provide a framework
* define a guideline for orientation
* Eisenhower: "leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you want done because he wants to do it."
* convince others to follow those decisions
![](10.png)
[task: mural page 5] Define examples for good and bad leadership
![](11.png)
* bad: showing no interest in tasks, not people; don't share important information; egocentric; indecisive
* reliability
* *what defines a good leader: ability - willingness - opportunity*
* leadership style used reflects his idea of man and his own self-.image
* which leadership style is used: depends on several factors:
  ** the superiors
  ** the employee(s)
  ** the situation
  ** the type of work
* so we need a toolbox of leadership styles
* styles: controlling, coordinating, delegating, conducting, steering, motivating, directing, collaborating, participating,
* Kurt Levin: leadership styles
![](12.png)
  maturity of the leadership
  ![](13.png)
  ![](14.png)
  ![](15.png)

![](16.png)
* the aphorism "what gets measured gets done"; is aligned with the MBO philosophy (KPI) [todo]
* Leadersheep (sic!)- Lead by example (if you can't do it, who else should?)
* work on yourselves
* Teamwork: start together to work as a team; individual conflicts shall step back;
![](17.png)
![](18.png)
![](19.png)
* giving the benefit of the doubt
* solve conflicts when they arise
* [todo] marshal rosenberg: nonviolent communication

* projects grow in number and complexity
* modern project teams include remote and international members and short project cycles are key to stay relevant
* managing is about making tradeoffs: variance from plan: increase cost to save time, decrease scope to save time, or reset project baseline
### 9 best practices for making

(completion criteria, milestones, project lifecycle)
* complete project team should know about budget: where are we? what is expected from members to stay within budget

```Role: Project Manager

Szenario:
Your company has received the order to plan a wedding. A project team with internal colleagues from different departments and externals is put together. 
Because of your experience, you have been selected as project manager. 
in one-to-one meetings, you explain the project and the tasks to the colleagues.

Exercise:
Prepare the discussion with the project controller and discuss the topic with him. 
The colleague is planned to work 30% of his working time on your project and you want to plan him quite flexible. There are several controller in your company but from your experience in other projects, you want this person so you have to convince him to come aboard. 

Timing: 
Preparation about 10 min
Discussion about 5 min
Feedback about. 10min
```
* intro: hello thiago, good morning. how are you? how is work going lately?
* I have a really nice and interesting project coming along. and since I am aware of your skills and experience I'd like that you take that over as controller.
* the task is to plan for a wedding.
* You will handle a mixed team of internal and external employees. you should dedicate 30% of your time for that.
* maybe I can support you to shift your responsibilites so that you have more free time.
--------
* went well, Thiago had already a proposed solution, so I wrapped him with the "I understand, you have a lot of experience, can we talk about details later"-technique
* todo: bring a proof of why a person did really well; so those strengths should be underlined with an example
--------
* a little bit of small talk can help to relax
* offer some relief: can we get I get you some help/resource
--------
--> sources of stress
![](39.png)
* or even a round table, because no corners; and it stops from hiding
![](40.png)
* compromise is only half of the solution; shared intentions would haqve resulted in victory with both
+ compromise: sometimes we don't put too much value into the things we fight for; or we don't dare a fight; or sometimes it is just our personality
![](41.png)
different conflict handling tools: when "it is important"  versus "not important", so that in the end you can be successful
Harvard concept: "Hart in der Sache, weich gegenüber den Menschen."
  1. Trennen sie Menschen und Sachfragen
  2. Interessen: Stellen Sie Interessen in den Mittelpunkt, nicht Positionen
  3. Erarbeiten sie Optionen, von denen alle profitieren
  4. Bestehen Sie auf objektive Kriterien
  ## new role play: project manager
```
Project Manager

Szenario:
Your company has received the order to plan a wedding. A project team with internal colleagues from different departments and externals is put together. 
Because of your experience, you have been selected as project manager. 
Some weeks after the project start, the controller complains about his working time. The superior of the controller has also been informed and questions the participation of the controller in the project. 
According to your recording, the working time of the controller does not exceed the agreed 30%. 

Exercise:
Prepare the discussion with the project controller and discuss the topic with him. 
Discuss why he feels overloaded by the project work. 
In case the superior of the controller shall be included, the trainer can play this role. 
```
* Hello Mahkameh, nice to see you.
* It has come to my ears that you have are experiencing an heavy workload?
* Your superior thinks you should be removed from the project due to the workload. On the other hand my numbers show that you work exactly 30% of the time.
* Is there a misconception? Are the number reported properly?
* How to keep the time-budget
* Delegate (more) work (to me)? Hire another controller?
---
* fidelity to the project; top project hsd top priority
* I want her in the project; anything else should be shifted along; less priority; 
* treat by being assigned: but else withdrawn and bad
