* 1. Leadership - Motivating Vision: create a motivating vision

     * when needed extrinsic motivation can be used
     * but rather work on the intrinsic motivation
* motivation factors change over time Generation XYZ are less  motivated by rules and clear vision; more by enjoyment and work-life-balance
* this means that the leadership approach needs to change

Motivation: official term

[insert Steva Jobs quote ..]

### Maslow's hierarchy of needs
![](05.png)* humang being is a group being: wants to be part of a group, sports team, friends, any other group* Maslow says that you have to finish one layer before you can ove up; later refined to "work on different layers at the same point of time"
* You cannot motivate anybody to do something he does not want to do.; but if you mange to revive intrinsic motivation - for example by fun and play - then you will be successful
* example: chalk number on the floor; factory; 5, then 6 ..

## Leadership
* get extraordinary achievement from ordinary people; Brian Tracy
* "An army of sheep led by a lion beats an army of lions led by a sheep" Arabic proverb
* ability of group or individuals to influence and guide other members of an organisation
* bad leadership: shouting, asking for the impossible; good: having a clear vision where to go
## responsibility of a leader: provide a framework
* define a guideline for orientation
* Eisenhower: "leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you want done because he wants to do it."
* convince others to follow those decisions
![](10.png)
[task: mural page 5] Define examples for good and bad leadership
![](11.png)
* bad: showing no interest in tasks, not people; don't share important information; egocentric; indecisive
* reliability
* *what defines a good leader: ability - willingness - opportunity*
* leadership style used reflects his idea of man and his own self-.image
* which leadership style is used: depends on several factors:
  ** the superiors
  ** the employee(s)
  ** the situation
  ** the type of work
* so we need a toolbox of leadership styles
* styles: controlling, coordinating, delegating, conducting, steering, motivating, directing, collaborating, participating,
