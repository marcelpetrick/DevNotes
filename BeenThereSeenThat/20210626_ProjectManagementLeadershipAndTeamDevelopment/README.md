     * easier to inspire them to support the project goal
     * when needed extrinsic motivation can be used
     * but rather work on the intrinsic motivation
* motivation factors change over time Generation XYZ are less  motivated by rules and clear vision; more by enjoyment and work-life-balance
* this means that the leadership approach needs to change
