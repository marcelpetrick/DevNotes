## notes
* evolutionary, start where you are currently, improve while you move
* Scrum would be revolutionary: creates also breaks
* manages the effort (the work), not the workers! -> "Watch the baton, not the runner!"
* the result is what matters
* customer not really itnerested what you do in detail, but what is delivered to him
* Kaizen: continuous improvement
* feedback loops
* past "visualize the work", now "visualize"
* just visualize the human work or everything? even automated things?
* kanban is board where YOU visualize how YOU work
* sequential versus multitasking ![](meetup_20210318_3.png)
* "get more done by doing less"; limit yourself on what you are doing, to be more predictable, and to deliver faster
*
