# 20230207: ST's webinar on NFC dynamic tags for simplified commissioning

* how to add new devices to an existing network?
* NFC for simplified commissioning

* two steps: configure the new device, then connection to the network
* usually pressing two buttons, waiting until a led is flashing ..
* users do not want to read catalogs to connect a smart home device
* plan: keep the commissioning easy
