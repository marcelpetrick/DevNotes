"Everything GenAI" is definitely a strong topic of the year 2024. After the first PoC wave in 2023 we're now at a point where we see more and more stories about real world applications. We as the AWS User Group Munich are very happy to have access to knowledgeable speakers who are able to tell us more about those GenAI solutions and how they were built with AWS.

This time we meet at the NTT Data office and thankfully get food and drinks provided.

AGENDA:
18:30 - Doors open, networking, drinks, food

19:00 - Markus Ostertag (AWS Hero): Recent AWS announcements

20:00 - Fuad Ibrahimov & Michael Loibl (NTT Data): Building Scalable Gen AI RAG Applications with AWS Serverless
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications provide valuable opportunities for leveraging the power of Generative AI. However, building enterprise-grade RAG applications can pose significant challenges. Although Amazon Q can offer quick solutions, managing the scale and complexity of such applications often requires more control than Amazon Q can provide. In this talk, we will explore how AWS Serverless services can be utilized to build a robust, scalable architectures that meet the needs of enterprise-grade RAG applications. Join us to learn how to achieve greater innovation and productivity in your RAG applications with AWS Serverless services.

21:00 - Andreas Jadrin (NTT Data): AI Companion: A Serverless Travel Copilot
Do you dream of a travel experience that's effortless and tailored to your every need? With the help of an AI copilot, that reality is closer than you think. Picture a companion providing you with proactive guidance and information while you are focusing on driving. We incorporate an LLM into a serverless application that is able to detect intentions and trigger suitable events in the cloud, resulting in a human-like and user tailored communication/conversation. Our serverless architecture, hosted on AWS employs services such as AWS Lambda, AWS IoT Core, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon S3, and AWS StepFunctions. Join us as we explore the transformative potential of AI and Cloud and the future of travel.
