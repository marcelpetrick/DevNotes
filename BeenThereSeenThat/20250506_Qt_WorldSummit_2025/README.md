* todo add notes from whatsapp

## Talk of the Vice president, 2nd talk
* todo add notes from whatsapp
* fragmentation is going to accelerate
* desktop going arm; just the start, wil be changed a lot mvoing forward, riscV is replacing ARM in some markets
* big technology divide between western world and china
* embrace fragmentation: write once, deploy everywhere - mantra 
*andIDe can be use which suport the lange server protocol
### AI - buzz in the market
* ast force, but Qt says that the human has to be in control
* humand-centered evelopment process
* harness the power ans speed of AI
* peter schneider as resident of development
* agentic AI

## peter schneider product manager
* agentic IDE demonstration
* genai for documentation, testecases and expert help
* genai will play a role in every single phase of the sw development lifecycle
* cursor, qt ai assistant..
* multiple steps to compete a certain task: from figma tod2qml, p2p review, qt test cas, squish test, code documentation - all done by agents
+ five agents which convert the consumer drawn ai into runing code
* slash create as command
* take ht epng and also the json as metadata, all the input for the LLM; runs most of the time antrhopic 3.7 sonnet
* defines sliders, switches buttons
* create a complete project and a software
* rather convenint starting point forthe experience
* organize it a bit differently
* review of code: four eyes princile
* ask another LLm o review the code of the other model: deepseek-version 3, friend from china to review the code
* the review is not enough, just a start, should have more knowledge - a good start, but needs fleshing out
* qtquick unit tests: components
* squis test cases as well - python
* documentatuon: of course also written by ai - in markdown format?!?
* human in the loop - adjusting where you go ..
* lots of developers will reject it
* but what if software takes away all the boring jobs?
* compiles well also usable directly - i am surprised (maybe nicely configured? why does it work on first try?)
* sonnet of one of the best LLMS
* impessive, cohesion between the communit ..
* QT inferenceAI ..integrate ai much easier
* qtquick3d scenes as second demo

### evolve integrate.
* most software does not start from zero
* core desin pricniple of Qt: scalable, flexible framework
* Qt Accelerate: as program from coneceptto fully functional prototype in 5 days
* templates for customer industry use-cases
* 5 day boot camp
* Framework built not just for today, but also for the future
* anticipate the future (by molding it ...)
* joint effort: evolve together
* safety, quality, security: people with no idea of software development are creating applications
* unprecendented pace: crtiical question how to ensure those three pillars?
* ai assistan for squish ai driven teting
* axivion for Cuda
* high powered computing: what is this?!?
* regulatory tsunami coming: EU CRA already in effect
* what to do to be compliant
* 5 years promise of LTS-releases: also extended security maintenance
* the winning teams will antiipate the change and leverage it
* quality assurance from day one: built it from day one
* embrce automation!
* open source model from day 1
* build beter technology
* greatest impact lies ahead
* qt for python has surpassed 1 mio downloads
### beyond C++!
* qml ridging technologies: python, swirft, java, rust, .net, kotlin
* bring th epower of qt to other applications and platforms
* QML as horizontal technology
* single frontend on any devic,with any language  impressive
* with great power omes great responsibility: what will you build next? question that lingers

----
* all sessions are avaialble after teh event as recording
* thank the sponsors: gold KDAB, silve: scythe studio, sli atuo felgo, spyrosoft, ICS, bronze: redhat and accenture song; last: rti, infineon

## the kaledoscope approach to the hmi development
'- roman leylin
* get a caleidoscope: twist and a new pattern emerges
* what is inside?
* ampled mirrors and tin colorful particles - reflections take over and a new mesmerizing patern appears
* hmi lead in harman auotmotive
* for scalalbe automtoive user environment
* goal was low cost and short time to market
* but ntead oflooking form outside, we get pulled inside
* n each layer is carefully selected information: layers, composition, communicatio, states, itnerfaces, priorization

## hmi gu from siemens - janos lenart (with accents)
* simatic hmi panels in the manufacturing
* efficient machine level operator control and monitoring
+ hmi panels are essential wherevere the humans interact with machines
* prove value across divers applications in all industrial sectors over many years
* a visualiation system design tot adress the challenge if digitalization in mahine and plant construmction
and much more, integreated with our comprehsenive world
+ the hidden icutre book for our engineers
* WinCC unified system  scalability: from machine to plant supervision
* separeted tesams: core, design, code
*mscreen model and ui templates:cutom behavuour
+ lirbary, data moduel, indirection, visutal teree
* clearf ofcus and performance nehanced
* architectural trade offs and decisions must be well checked+
* lead developers must be proud of their code and their work
* no uncessary tradeoffs no workarounds
* governance of the code by the lead dvelopers
* everyone has to have a anel ntheir desk - with real hardware; right at the desktop
* organization -> architecture -> code -> testing
* no brainer, straight forward
* but in org where you ahve severla hundred developers working ont he ame product and regulatory changes all the time, sidderent features everydays, easy to forget thsese ideas
* bring those impulses innto the teams every day
* this brought them bakc to their embedded roots - great closing word
