# What is Team Health?
* A self-assessment tool for agile project teams looking to improve their collaboration.
* Like humans, teams are living organisms.
* Teams carry emotions, encounter conflicts, and seek a sense of purpose.
* Communication, velocity, culture have an impact on the outcome.
* Healthy teams build better products.
* Interaction:
  * How valuable do you find team health in your team?
  * If a question or statistic is plummeting, which impact does it have?

* Team Health (TH) is a metric to have a more objective look at the very subjective constitution of the team.
* In former times, it was done with company surveys, then calculated, then presented.
* Example of working together for several sprints:
* Normally, with the first iteration.
* Most likely a dip after the start of a team, then it increases.
* How to avoid problems and how to boost team morale.
* Something where the Scrum Master has to take action.

### Avoid - Beware of These
* Measuring individuals instead of a team.
* Using metrics as a micromanagement tool.
* Focusing on the absolute values.
* Ignoring patterns over time.
* Missing analysis of the results.
* Comparing results of teams.

## Patterns Over Time (Examples):
* Always when we onboard new people to the team.
* Every August, the team health falls down.
* When the Product Owner is on holiday.
* Each time we get feedback from the customer.
* Every third sprint.

## Taking Action From It
* Why, why, why, why...?
  * What is the root cause?
* Fishbone diagram: rituals, team, roles, environment -> demanding Product Owner -> decreasing team health.
* Enabling people-driven transformation.
