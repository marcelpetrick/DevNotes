# what is team health?
*
* self assesment tool for agile prohjec teams who look to improve their work together
* like humans, teams are living organisms
* teams carry emotions, encoutern conflicts, seek a sense of purpose

* communiction, velocity, culture have impact on outcome
* healthy teams build better products
* interaction:
  * how valuable do you find tema health in youir team?
  * if a question or statistic is plummetting, which impct does it have?

* TH is a metric to have a more objective look at the very subjective constituion of the team
* in former time it was done with company surveys, then calculates, then presented
* example working together for several sprints:
  img06
* normally with the first iteration
* most likely a dip after the start of a team, then it increases
* how to avoid problems and how to boost team morale
* something where the scrum master has to take action

### avoid - beware of these
* measuring individuals instead of a team
* using metrics as a micromanagement tool
* focussing on the absolute values
* ignoring patterns over time
* missing analysis of the results
* comparing results of teams

## patterns over time (examples):
* always when we onboard new people in the team
* every August the team health falls down
* when the product owner is on holiday
* each time we get feedback from the customer
* every third sprint

## taking action from it
* why, why, why, why ..?
  * what is the root cause?
* fishbone diagram: rituals, team, roles, environment -> demanding product owner -> decreasing team health
* enabling people driven transformation
