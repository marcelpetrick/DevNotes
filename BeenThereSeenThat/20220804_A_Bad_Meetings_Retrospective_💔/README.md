# A Bad Meetings Retrospective ðŸ’”
* improve meeting effectiveness in an Agile team
* Paddy Corry is an Agile coach; writes for "Serious Scrum"

```
ABOUT THE TALK Bad Meetings don't have to be a fact of life. With facilitation techniques, Agile teams can avoid some pitfalls that make meetings really bad. Retrospectives for example. While the meeting is good, Retrospective formats can get repetitive. In this talk, Paddy will share some techniques to help with facilitation of any event, and some Retrospective formats to give you some ideas. The Bad Meeting Game is one of those Retrospectives that can pull all these ideas together, and help inspire an Agile team on how to make meetings better!
