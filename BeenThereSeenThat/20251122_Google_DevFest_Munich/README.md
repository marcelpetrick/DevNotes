## luiz carbeiro - solution engineer
* ¹ houer  very hot
* so we will get a homework, if we dont make it
* build with gemini: lets explore the agent development kit
* what is the ADK? felxbile and mdular dev kit
* he is a terminal person: browsr and terminal: two software for him
* hardcore programming, fast
* DK IS MODEL AGNOSTIC:for developing and deplyong aiagents
* it is about dveloepr experience: simple. simple list in python
* lot of prompt engineering: cimple for dvelopers
* model agnostic, deplyoment agnostic, compatible with other frameworks
  * so just use whatever you want
  * in the end we have a docker container: can go to any platform as a service
  * langchain: importing tools also possible
* setup gcp and gemini api key; ai eng develop your own agent, or cloud engineers more ai agents ifrastructure
* maYBE NIT ONLY PYTHON BUT MORE FOR SCALING AND HOW TO MAINTAIN OBSERVABILITY
* trygcp.dev/claim/devfest-munich
* ai,studio
* import my created projecT: devfest2025
* crate api key
* clone this repo: carneiro.dev/track1
* CLONED THE REPO: /home/mpetrick/repos/carneiro_ai_engineering_ttrack/DevFest25-WS/P6-SequentialAgents/ GOT TO THIS EXERCISE

export GOOGLE_API_KEY='AIzaSyBb87ipYYZarmA5'


# Shared environment variables for all workshop agents
# Copy this file to .env and add your actual API key

# Get your API key from: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/onramp/instructions#1
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyBb87ipYYZar

Followed to run with local environment:
```
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate && uv sync
adk web --port 8000  # Web UI at http://localhost:8000
```
* open then 127.0.0.1:8000 wtgh


of course, this is dangerous, but i will invalidate it later - already shortened.

--------
observability

also try p1 and so on..

--------

* now go to carneiro.dev/track2
  * this resolves to https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-run/use-mcp-server-on-cloud-run-with-an-adk-agent#2
* wqhy to deploy to cloud run?
* creatr an agent workflow? tab 5
  * deploy your own mcp server? (not have done this - because another lab)
  * goo.gle/aaiwcr-2 - for a public mcp server
  PROJECT_NUMBER=90783857331
----

* P1: angety.py to check first: with the prompt
* p5: router agents: way different and more complex; tasks requests delegation: so a first agent is created; then a foodie-agent; specialist 3 is an agent for eevents ads guide;
* wrap the agents as tools: 

* google cloud skills: carneiro.dev/skills - 
* go to https://www.skills.google/ - credits based courses; pay theorethically
