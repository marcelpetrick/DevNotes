* build with gemini: lets explore the agent development kit
* what is the ADK? felxbile and mdular dev kit
* he is a terminal person: browsr and terminal: two software for him
* hardcore programming, fast
* DK IS MODEL AGNOSTIC:for developing and deplyong aiagents
* it is about dveloepr experience: simple. simple list in python
* lot of prompt engineering: cimple for dvelopers
* model agnostic, deplyoment agnostic, compatible with other frameworks
  * so just use whatever you want
  * in the end we have a docker container: can go to any platform as a service
  * langchain: importing tools also possible
* setup gcp and gemini api key; ai eng develop your own agent, or cloud engineers more ai agents ifrastructure
* maYBE NIT ONLY PYTHON BUT MORE FOR SCALING AND HOW TO MAINTAIN OBSERVABILITY
