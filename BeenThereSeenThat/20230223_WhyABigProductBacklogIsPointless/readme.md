# 20230223 - Why a large product backlog is pointless

## Intro from teh meetup-description
```
Product management is about getting the right things done. It is easy to come up with a list of things to add to make something better. It is much harder to decide which things to leave out to make something better. *"The things you own end up owning you." - Tyler Durden* The same logic applies to your Product Backlog. In this session Maarten Dalmyn will tell us, how do we prevent it from happening and what we could learn from Marie Kondo when it comes to tidying up our Product Backlog. Never heard about Marie Kondo? Her Marie Kondo Principle, also known as the KonMari Method, provides her followers with a model for making tidying up a fulfilling and meaningful task. **About our Speaker** Maarten Dalmijn has worked with many award-winning start-ups, scale-ups and corporations in various roles before taking the leap as an independent Product Management, Agile and Scrum consultant working with companies all over the globe. By blending the world of Product Management and Agile, Maarten helps teams to beat the Feature Factory and uncover better ways of delivering value together. **General Information** * We are happy to do this session in english. * We will start at 4pm * After Maartens Session there is time for Q&A *

* become stale over time, becauzse company or product changes direction
* fixed as part of some other issue
* technical architecture has changed
