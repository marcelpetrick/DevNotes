# 20230720 Analyzing C++ applications for performance optimization

```
On July, 20th, we have the pleasure to welcome Elizaveta Shulankina to our user group. Elizaveta Shulankina is a senior software development engineer at Intel Corporation with 7 years of experience, using C++ as a primary tool. She is part of the team developing Intel Profiler tools, these tools help design and optimize code for modern computer architectures. She holds a Master's degree in Computer Science from State University of Nizhniy Novgorod (UNN), Russia. *** **Abstract**: Some of us, willingly or not, have needed to analyze the code for performance improvements. Of course, we resorted to various code profilers to figure out what was wrong with our perfectly written code... And more often than not, the profiler surprised us by pointing out a performance bottleneck in the code! This talk will be an introduction to C++ application performance optimization using tools such as Intel VTune Profiler and Intel Advisor. We'll briefly walk through the performance optimization steps, then take a small C++ application and ask VTune and Advisor to help us understand what's going on, what the performance bottlenecks are and how we can deal with them to make our application memory and compute efficient. We'll do a few iterations of tunning this C++ application and see how it speeds up. *** **Agenda:** 19:00 -- Welcome with Snacks and Drinks 19:30 -- Welcome at Zeiss 19:40 -- Main talk by Elizaveta Shulankina \~21:00 -- Open Discussions 22:00 -- Official End \*\*\* **Link to the live stream: TBA** \*\*\* **Sponsor**: Research Microscopy Solutions Deutschland (https://www.zeiss.de/mikroskopie/home.html)
