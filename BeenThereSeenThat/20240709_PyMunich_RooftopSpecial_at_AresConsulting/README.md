less comoetition of big players
crypto markets wuite noisy
sample: linear regessionaand gradient boost
can.say with any statisticla.certainty. odd squares and t test
checklist creates a very stable trading bot
divsrsity of profiles: 25 percent right is good enough in case of enough stuff to.win
volatility is key
.......

financial.and encironmental.costs
* ai grow by 280 bln
data.scientist.40.blnn
* eatimations. traberse and aloocate binary trees. 
3 hours to 3.month runtime.with same.energy conpared germany to kenya
can using vertain packages make it more efficient
assignment ooeratoe and comma methodntonprint strings..double usage
comparing numpy and pandas. 10 mio inputs, numoy.faster and consumes less enetgy
compiling for.speed is compiling for energy
full.throttle is more wfficient
enegry = power * time
race to sleep. eveb with uneveb usage
better to save energy by less time.or memory usage..python stands up
example.pythonn script removing duplicates in aws lambda

........
top zo bottom.feedbakc loops
get error from.trst and move on. 

as little.as possible.in unknown states: want to know what the error is about
really being on the known path will.gibe you the feeling of peogrss!
put yourarlf in thebconsuner shoes
public interface of the class is tested
* add tests to increase confidence
find a tradeoff between thr cotst.and thr tisks of the tests..if a trst does not provide anything useful, you might deletr it
