File I/O: Past, Present, and Future
File I/O: Past, Present, and Future
Details

This month we have the great pleasure to welcome Guy Davidson to our user group. Guy has been writing games and using C++ for longer than most people have been alive. After a nearly 25 year stint at Creative Assembly, leaving as Head of Engineering Practice, he is now enjoying the freelance lifestyle and has a couple of exciting projects on the boil.

He is the co-author of Beautiful C++, a voting member of the C++ Standards Committee, a lifelong mathematician and whiles away his copious spare time playing the piano, singing first bass in the Brighton Festival Chorus, and experimenting in the kitchen.
Youâ€™ll find him on some of the socials as hatcat01

Abstract
If you have played a game on a computer in the last few decades, you will most likely have encountered a loading screen. This is used to advertise to the player that, among other things, data is being loaded from a storage device into the game. But why does this exist, why does it take so long, and how can we improve matters for the player?

In this talk we will discover the history of games and their development environments, the relationship between address space, RAM and storage hardware, how C++ abstracts file I/O and why it might not be the best fit for game developers, how a 64-bit address space changes everything, how #embed will change everything, and how C++29 (yes, 29) may upset the applecart yet again.

Although this talk is aimed at game developers who are often Windows programmers, it is relevant to anyone who has to read large amounts of data from local storage. Expect tales of woe, discovery and jubilation as I describe every surprising little thing I've learned about file I/O over the past 40 years and how C++ is heading for a great future in games.

Lightning Talk

Title: homcc - a traffic-efficient distributed C/C++ compiler

Abstract: homcc is an open-source, distributed C/C++ compiler which tries to minimize network traffic so that compilations can efficiently be distributed in low-bandwidth network environments. This talk will outline how homcc works, what features are available and how it compares to alternatives.

Presenters: Oliver Layer and Simon Pirsch (both Celonis Software Engineers)
