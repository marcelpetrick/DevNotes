## agenda
```
Details

In 2014 the AWS User Group Munich started with the first events in a beer garden (it's Munich!) and a few AWS enthusiasts. And we're very excited to be able to celebrate the 10th anniversary of this AWSome group now! This is why we also do things a little different this time.

Thanks to adesso SE for sponsoring food, drinks and opening their office for us.

For this special occasion we deviate a bit from our regular agenda:
18:30 - Doors open, networking, drinks, food

19:00 - Constantin Gonzalez Schmitz (Principal SA @ AWS): AI/ML at Amazon: What we learned over the years

20:00 - Markus Ostertag (AWS Hero): Recent AWS announcements

20:30 - Meyyar Palaniappan: A special surprise announcement

20:45 - Michael Wahlers (Head of Technology @ AWS): Let's play AWS BuilderCards!

21:00 - BuilderCards, more drinks, more networking
```

## Intro by Markus
* celebrating the anniversary

## Constantin Gonzalez Schmitz (Principal SA @ AWS): AI/ML at Amazon: What we learned over the years
* Constantin as first AWS solution architect
* "transforming customer experiences through AI-enabled innovations at Amazon.com"
* working for AWS since 2021
* amazon intends to become the worlds most customer cnetric company
* not be afraid of competition or customers, someone offers them a better service
* TODO check the quote from jeff bezos
* there is no hardware or contract attached to that, so if customers find their service someehwre else, they go to the next vendor
* what is the customer promise: very specific customer promise; order in 2 h and 8 min to get it tomorrow
  * behind that is a very expansive sstem: more than 400 mio products; multiple levels of broadcasting
  * forecasting -> capacity -> buying -> placement -> fulfillment
  * accurate delivery promise
  * some are obvious, like seasonal stuff; others are not obvious (children's crazy costumes..)
* start with a simple approach: input -> program -> output
* relies on what humans can observe and program
* machine learning is different: take the available data, feed into algorithm, algorithm does it for your, the model -> get the output: you get a statistial answer
*
