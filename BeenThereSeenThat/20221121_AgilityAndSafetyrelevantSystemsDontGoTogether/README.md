# 20221121 - Agility and safety-relevant systems don't go together!? Or do they?
* trainer: Matthias Größler (safety expert) & Konstantin Ribel (agility expert)
```
More often than not, people state that companies cannot be agile because they are building safety-relevant products. People are referring to the ISO26262 and how it contradicts to the statements in the Agile Manifesto. In this meetup Matthias (a safety expert) and Konstantin (an agility expert) will have a, maybe controversial, session on this topic. Join and discuss together with them. This event will happen online together with the LeSS meetup in Berlin.
