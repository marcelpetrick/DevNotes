# 20230927 AWS UG Munich September Event

```
With the AWS Community Day DACH on Sept 14th (register here: https://www.aws-community-day.de/) we have the most exciting AWS Community event of the year in our home town, but nevertheless we keep up the pace with another meetup of the AWS UG Munich just 2 weeks after!

And this meetup will be a special one as Viktoria Semaan from AWS San Diego will join us!

This time we meet at ARES Consulting and as always get food and drinks sponsored. Let's pray for good weather as we then can enjoy their fabulous roof top terraces!

AGENDA:

18:30 - Doors open, networking, drinks, food

19:15 - Markus Ostertag (AWS Hero): Recent AWS announcements

20:00 - Viktoria Semaan (AWS) & Maarten Smeets (Mendix) & Ravi Singh (Mendix): Architecting highly available, multi-Region applications

21:00 - Jonatan Steuernagel (ARES Consulting) - IPv6: Why and How to Embrace it Today, using Transitional Mechanisms

21:45 - More drinks, more networking

If you have an office or co-working space where we can meet (100-150 people), want to sponsor drinks/food or have a (lightning) talk you want to present - please let us know!

Everyone who participates in an AWS UG Munich event must adhere to the Code of Conduct!
