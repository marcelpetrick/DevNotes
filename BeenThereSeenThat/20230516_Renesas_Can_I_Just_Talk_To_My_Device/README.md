```
This session is part of our Renesas Virtual Conference. Registration/event page here. We are all familiar with cloud-based natural language recognition, but what can you do to enhance the usability of your products with voice if you are not connected? Join us to get an overview of the Renesas ecosystem around voice UI algorithms that run efficiently on their MCUs ? with resources and cycles left over for your application on the same device. You will also see how their acquisition of RealityAI and their efficient ML can be used to enhance your products.
