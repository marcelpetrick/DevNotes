Welcome and Introductions
Welcome words from the organizers Sebastian & Lisa

11 am
Project suggestions
You can either present your own neurotech idea or you can join someone else

Team building
By now there should be a couple of 3-5 person teams 

2 pm
Start hacking & building
Start working on your ideas/projects 

8 pm
End of the first day
We won't close the building, you can also work through the night if you want to

Schedule: Sunday 30.October
12 pm
Lunch together

* todo: check the discord: there are some ressources and stuff
* equipment:
  * three openbci bords
  * one musebit?
* evaluation by the guys from blackrock tomorrow
* neurotechx munich: connect people who want to become experts in that space
* companies: openbci starter kit, raspberry pis
* over 600 people world wide, different locations
* pairing with people in the room or worldwide
* 3-4 slides, one minute pitch; 3 pm for the pitch

* todo: book: the neurotech primer - buy this
xr biosense 2022; was online in 2022
* three tracks: tech/handson / the data challnge / design/strategy
* links for the datassets will be published as well: to handle that task maybe later
* in the ende everything goes for design/strategy
* 1 hackathon, 600 signups, 6 in person locations, 6 judges, 16 happy sponsors, awesome prize pool ..

hackathon process walkthrough:
* first welcome-rules; resourrces in the files ..
* my intro for the discord-channel

Greetings, I am Marcel. I am a software engineer with some experience in C++/Qt/Python and Desktop and embedded environments. My experience with the whole BCI topic is zero (sadly), I just stumbled over that quite interesting field two week ago. But I am willing to learn and participate and bring in my skills. github: https://github.com/marcelpetrick - located in Munich. Would prefer a local team 🙂

## g.tec medical engineering:
* bio-engineering, medical eletronics, bio-electricity
* developing hard- and software products for biosignal research
* mainly: austria: schiedlberg, austria
* EEG or ECOG (for invasive) interfaces
* BCI is analysizing the signals
* you always need a task for stimulation for the subject
* device could be the easiest one your computer
* FMRI or MEG are skipped for this, because not optimal and slow
* Electrocorticogram: ECoG: surgery is needed
* Electroencephalogram (EEG) - easy ot apply and the signal is pretty good
  * moderate spacial resolution, hih temporal resolution, low signal tonoise ratio, 0-40Hz, 1-64(128) channels, 1 mV - 100 mV
* important is to get a clean EEG signal; if the subject is clenching with teeth, then the signal degrades much
* unicorn-bi.com - a brain interface - https://www.unicorn-bi.com/product/unicorn-hybrid-black/ - 999€ ..
* todo: bee bot kaufen ... 92 euro
* g.Tec Suite 2020: for anccess to the channels, programming interfaces, just output of data - all in one
* how to do measurems, how to mount a cap? active electrodes, which amplify the signal put cap on, then chin strap, the massage it to the head, reference electrode on the earlobe (with gel), one electrode on the forehead as groudn eelctrode (yellow), the inject gel in all of the signal electrodes, then with gel really clean signals, takes roundabout 2 minutes
