# 20240126 C++ Patterns for Non-Safety-Critical Automotive Software Development

```
Details

On January 26th we have the pleasure to welcome Antons Jelkins to our user group. Antons has been using C++ professionally since 2009. He joined BMW Car IT GmbH as a C++ developer in 2013 and, with interruptions, stays there up to this day. After some years in the company he became responsible for several overarching topics in a major navigation component, such as a build system, an application lifecycle, communication and framework. He later used this experience to help design and implement other applications to run inside cars. Antons truly believes that it is important to have common abstractions, conventions and techniques, that it is in company's best interests to solve a problem really well once and then adopt the solution. With these ideas in mind, Antons co-started a C++ application framework project which now gets adopted by ever increasing number of non-safety-critical applications within BMW.

Abstract
In this talk I would like to share how we use C++ to develop non-safety-critical software which runs inside BMW cars, and how a C++ application framework helps us with this. I would like to provide an overview of how a generic C++ application looks like: what techniques, building blocks and patterns does it use etc.
