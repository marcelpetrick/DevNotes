Details

Spring time in Munich! After our successful collaboration with the AWS Women's User Group in March we're coming back to our regular setting and looking forward to see many of you!
This time at netlight, who are sponsoring food, drinks and opening their offices for us. Thanks for also providing two great talks!

AGENDA:
18:00 - Doors open, networking, drinks, food

18:30 - Markus Ostertag (AWS Hero): Recent AWS announcements

19:15 - Lea Schumann & Pinar Ayaz (netlight): Building a Scalable GenAI Architecture with AWS
Discover how we built a scalable, cost-efficient GenAI architecture on AWS to solve a real-world use case. Learn practical insights from integrating GenAI at multiple touchpoints, achieving rapid scalability, and optimizing for impact at the intersection of innovation, business, and cloud technology. This talk dives into the challenges, solutions, and lessons learned in bringing a complex business case to life in production using GenAI.

20:00 - Johannes GÃ¼nther & Florian Siegel (netlight): AWS Landing Zones: Self built or standard with ControlTower?
Let's dive deep into AWS landing zones, what this is and how to build them. We will take you on the journey of two approaches we have implemented in client projects: One of them with AWS ControlTower and the AWS Landing Zone Accelerator and the other 100% hand made. Let's discover how those were set up, the pros and cons of them and the lessons learned.

20:45 - More drinks, more networking
