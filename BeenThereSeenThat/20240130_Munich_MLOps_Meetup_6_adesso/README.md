# isabella GEiÃŸ
* adessor on f the leading  I service providers in germany
** project management  officer

## saumya - leveraging opensource tools (todo check the agenda for correct name)
*leveraging OSS tools for advanced ML pipelines
* MLops engineer from some consultancy extends service to BSH home appliances group
* regular conference speaker
* part time lectuer at macromedia hochschule
* msc informatics TUM
* AWS certified solutins architect
  * all quite impresive
* comes from DAtamics: helps audio, bmw, bsh, dailmer, vodafone - create content on udemy
* talks at ML convered and pydata; she mentioned rene brunner as well
### why oss tools?
* labelstudio
* fifty one
* it costs nothing, until and unless you wish to experinece entreprise version, deplyoing exlcusivfeatures, require extensive support
* excellent capabilities to customiue ad fixx: ad plugins, augment feautres, fix bugs
* no misue of data
* fulfillsthe technical demands
* allows to become creative with code
avoid becoming a code monkey
requires a dedicated techinal understanding
* some sophsiticated tools: data exploration and ..
TODO add img from phone with the tools
### label studio
* labelling tool: mutliple projects, users and data types
* supports images, video, audio, time series, formats
* supported format: JSOn CSV, TXT ... cloud support as well for AWS, gPC, azure
* integrates wellmitMl models tosupply predictions for label or perform continuous active learnin
* highly cutomisable interface
* intuitive desing
* well documented
* she recommends this tool really much
* look and fell: cloudflare, nvidia, meta use this ..
* labelling configuration is done via XML: object, control, visual
* can be set up wit one Compute, one Store and one ostgreSQL item n AWS forisntance
  * can also be put into docker, or be replaced with local installations
## next tool: (Voxel) FiftyOne
* for CV tasks
* tool for building high quality datassts and CV models
visualize datasheets and interpret models
core features: curating datasets, identify possible label mistakes in your datasets, evaluatiog models, embeddings visualzations, working wiht geolocations: storng, visualizing, querying datasets by location+
* powerful plugin framewok for extending and customizing the functionality of the tols#ailityto orchestrate tasks wiith apache airflow, etc.
* used by MS, lego, ..
* opensource version allows only local dataset, closed one has remote data storage/usage
* feature: FiftyOne Brain: finding problems
TODO add img of the example
* standard workflow: load dataset intoremote machine, launc fiftyone remote sessions, ssh into this remote server - cn be restricted to a particualr ip/host
* allows also usage with notebooks (juypter)

## how to integrate labelstudio and fityone?
* proposed workflow: raw daa -> visualize and curate dataset -> send it for labelling -> receive the labelled data ->
TODO add image for the workflow
TODO image of the archivetcure for AWS
* possible to put both configs into one EC2; but better searate, because labellers and data scientists are different

## plug and play: your call
* understand the needs of your data scientists and their roadblocks - communicate
* explore teh plethora of tools available in the OSS world
* new tools are released often - find your flavor
* find the tools which have room for customization
* example: add custom plugin in fiftyone (very well documentesd process for directed creativitiy)
* save some money* dont stick to one tool forever
* avoid vendor lockin by desgning your architecture like lego
* contribute to the open source communicaty, beceause you can

# second talk - MemeGPT (TODO add proper title from agenda)
* Stefan Ojanen - Director of product management at Genesis Cloud
* how to create memes with LLMs
* unleashing huor with ai
* largest database for memes: imgflip.com
* roadmap for memGPT
* training on different sets of powerful hardware: 8x nvidia H110 versus 8x Intel Gaudi2 AI
* his third startup he is working at: has already some exit plans
* chatgpt has problems to understand memes,
* paper: Dank Learning: generating memes using deep neural networks
* based on LSTMs - already way back the idea, before transformers

### attention is not all you need, daa is what you need - imgflip.com
* where to get data? imgflig, 650k mem templates
* mailed the founder: 40 million individula user created memes
### brief hsitory of LLMs
* word2vec (2013) -> LSTM (RNN) 1997--2017> transformers 2017
 - -> Hyena &Mmba (2023 -)* google translate is for instance google translate, or alexa
* so mamba is a good competitor

## why do mems mater?
* fac:t: 49% of americans dont understand irony
* humor harder than any business case
* humor: sarcasm/irony
* contextuality
* subjectivity
* linguistic nuances

### can robots crack ajjoke? july 2023
* memes are multimodal
* Meme drift - Cosimo Iaia - personal friedn
* memes incorporate cultural drift (evolution) much fast than expressions and word in language

### sampling
* lots of work dealing iwht teh data, not work with the model
* 256 most common templates; only english memes; on dataset for the metadata for 650k templates, 40 mio invidiual mems
* data looked prety nasty into something nicely looking stuff
* readable sturcutre -> huging face format

### roadmap
* model development -> concept -> POC -> release candidate -> final model -> multimodal model
* model servin, GC internal K8s + Triton, imgflip.com
* some small OSS LLMS they tried: stable-lm, redpajama, eleutherAI/pythia-2.8b
## implementation
* they offer theigr high end short term test platform for 2$/hr starting with february
* llama2-70b: parameter-effficient fine-tuning using LoRa adapters
* recommended reading ram efficient pytorch
TODO add img about the drake meme
* fine-tuning an LLM: by showing examples ofwhat you expect; to affect the beahviour of the model, ossible wiht releaitvely little data
* 16h for one tuning run

## what is Lora: low rank adapatio pf large langue models
* take a fozen model with its parameters, change matrix= lora updated paameters
* Gaudi2 looks like the real contender against the H100
* some explanes form the llama2-70b
* what is the treshold for "Large"?

### recent developments and why to do it yourself
* while openai is still working on understanding memes, we are already creating them -> just do it yourself!
* why?
  * mantain full control
  * no external dependencies
  * tooling widely available
* al the used code is boilerplate stuff, nothing really fancy - his words
* special thanks from him to: dylan wenzlau, the founder of imglfip.com; maroune khouk is the AI evangelist; stefan ojanen is the director of product managemnt
* how powerful the machine is neded to make the machine: similar to the finetuning machine
* is this model used in day to day? not yet, lan to ntegrate and offer API to imgflip
* RAG: not used here, idea is to be totally in model - not retrieved
* book "thinking fast and slow": the llm is a fast brain; how to make it more thoughful: chain of reasining, RAG, ..
  * RAG is deucing hallucinations; but for memes you don't want to mimic. the mdel should generalize and geenrate completyl new content!
* yes, they used a good ra, when everyone is fighting for machines
