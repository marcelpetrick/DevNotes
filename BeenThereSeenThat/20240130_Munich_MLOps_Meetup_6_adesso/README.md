# Isabella GeiÃŸ
* adesso the leading provider for IT services in Germany
* Project Management Officer usually and today the host

## Saumya - Leveraging Open-Source Tools (todo: check the agenda for correct name) <-- check: Saumya Goyal
* Leveraging OSS tools for advanced ML pipelines
* MLOps engineer from some consultancy extends service to BSH Home Appliances Group
* Regular conference speaker
* Part-time lecturer at Macromedia Hochschule
* MSc Informatics TUM
* AWS Certified Solutions Architect
  * All quite impressive
* Comes from Datamics: helps Audi, BMW, BSH, Daimler, Vodafone - create content on Udemy
* Talks at ML Convered and PyData; she mentioned Rene Brunner as well
### Why OSS Tools?
* LabelStudio
* FiftyOne
* It costs nothing, until and unless you wish to experience enterprise version, deploying exclusive features, require extensive support
* Excellent capabilities to customize and fix: add plugins, augment features, fix bugs
* No misuse of data
* Fulfills the technical demands
* Allows to become creative with code
* Avoid becoming a code monkey
* Requires a dedicated technical understanding
* Some sophisticated tools: data exploration and ... <-- check: additional tools
TODO: add image from phone with the tools
### Label Studio
* Labeling tool: multiple projects, users, and data types
* Supports images, video, audio, time series, formats
* Supported format: JSON, CSV, TXT ... Cloud support as well for AWS, GCP, Azure
* Integrates well with ML models to supply predictions for label or perform continuous active learning
* Highly customizable interface
* Intuitive design
* Well documented
* She recommends this tool really much
* Look and feel: Cloudflare, NVIDIA, Meta use this ...
* Labeling configuration is done via XML: object, control, visual
* Can be set up with one Compute, one Store, and one PostgreSQL item on AWS for instance
  * Can also be put into Docker, or be replaced with local installations
## Next Tool: (Voxel) FiftyOne
* For CV tasks
* Tool for building high-quality datasets and CV models
* Visualize datasheets and interpret models
* Core features: curating datasets, identifying possible label mistakes in your datasets, evaluating models, embeddings visualizations, working with geolocations: storing, visualizing, querying datasets by location
* Powerful plugin framework for extending and customizing the functionality of the tools
* Ability to orchestrate tasks with Apache Airflow, etc.
* Used by MS, LEGO, ...
* Open-source version allows only local dataset, closed one has remote data storage/usage
* Feature: FiftyOne Brain: finding problems
TODO: add image of the example
* Standard workflow: load dataset into remote machine, launch FiftyOne remote sessions, SSH into this remote server - can be restricted to a particular IP/host
* Allows also usage with notebooks (Jupyter)

## How to Integrate LabelStudio and FiftyOne?
* Proposed workflow: raw data -> visualize and curate dataset -> send it for labeling -> receive the labeled data ->
TODO: add image for the workflow
TODO: image of the architecture for AWS
* Possible to put both configs into one EC2; but better separate, because labelers and data scientists are different

## Plug and Play: Your Call
* Understand the needs of your data scientists and their roadblocks - communicate
* Explore the plethora of tools available in the OSS world
* New tools are released often - find your flavor
* Find the tools which have room for customization
* Example: add custom plugin in FiftyOne (very well documented process for directed creativity)
* Save some money
* Don't stick to one tool forever
* Avoid vendor lock-in by designing your architecture like LEGO
* Contribute to the open-source community, because you can

# Second Talk - MemeGPT (TODO: add proper title from agenda) <-- check: Unleashing Humor with AI: MemeGPT
* Stefan Ojanen - Director of Product Management at Genesis Cloud
* How to create memes with LLMs
* Unleashing humor with AI
* Largest database for memes: imgflip.com
* Roadmap for MemeGPT
* Training on different sets of powerful hardware: 8x NVIDIA H110 versus 8x Intel Gaudi2 AI
* His third startup he is working at: has already some exit plans
* ChatGPT has problems understanding memes
* Paper: Dank Learning: Generating Memes Using Deep Neural Networks
* Based on LSTMs - already way back the idea, before transformers

### Attention is Not All You Need, Data is What You Need - imgflip.com
* Where to get data? Imgflip, 650k meme templates
* Mailed the founder: 40 million individual user-created memes
### Brief History of LLMs
* Word2Vec (2013) -> LSTM (RNN) 1997--2017 > Transformers 2017
 - -> Hyena & Mamba (2023 -) * Google Translate is for instance Google Translate, or Alexa
* So Mamba is a good competitor

## Why Do Memes Matter?
* Fact: 49% of Americans don't understand irony
* Humor harder than any business case
* Humor: sarcasm/irony
* Contextuality
* Subjectivity
* Linguistic nuances

### Can Robots Crack a Joke? July 2023
* Memes are multimodal
* Meme Drift - Cosimo Iaia - personal friend
* Memes incorporate cultural drift (evolution) much faster than expressions and words in language

### Sampling
* Lots of work dealing with the data, not work with the model
* 256 most common templates; only English memes; one dataset for the metadata for 650k templates, 40 million individual memes
* Data looked pretty nasty into something nicely looking stuff
* Readable structure -> Hugging Face format

### Roadmap
* Model development -> Concept -> POC -> Release candidate -> Final model -> Multimodal model
* Model serving, GC internal K8s + Triton, imgflip.com
* Some small OSS LLMs they tried: Stable-LM, RedPajama, EleutherAI/Pythia-2.8b
## Implementation
* They offer their high-end short-term test platform for $2/hr starting in February
* Llama2-70b: parameter-efficient fine-tuning using LoRa adapters
* Recommended reading: RAM efficient PyTorch
TODO: add image about the Drake meme
* Fine-tuning an LLM: by showing examples of what you expect; to affect the behavior of the model, possible with relatively little data
* 16h for one tuning run

## What is LoRa: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models
* Take a frozen model with its parameters, change matrix = LoRa updated parameters
* Gaudi2 looks like the real contender against the H100
* Some examples from the Llama2-70b
* What is the threshold for "Large"?

### Recent Developments and Why to Do It Yourself
* While OpenAI is still working on understanding memes, we are already creating them -> just do it yourself!
* Why?
  * Maintain full control
  * No external dependencies
  * Tooling widely available
* All the used code is boilerplate stuff, nothing really fancy - his words
* Special thanks from him to: Dylan Wenzlau, the founder of imgflip.com; Maroune Khouk is the AI evangelist; Stefan Ojanen is the Director of Product Management
* How powerful the machine is needed to make the machine: similar to the fine-tuning machine
* Is this model used in day-to-day? Not yet, plan to integrate and offer API to imgflip
* RAG: not used here, idea is to be totally in model - not retrieved
* Book "Thinking Fast and Slow": the LLM is a fast brain; how to make it more thoughtful: chain of reasoning, RAG, ..
  * RAG is reducing hallucinations; but for memes you don't want to mimic. The model should generalize and generate completely new content!
* Yes, they used a good RA, when everyone is fighting for machines
