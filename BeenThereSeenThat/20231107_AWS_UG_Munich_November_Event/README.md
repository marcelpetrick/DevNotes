AWS UG Munich November Event

Christmas is just a few weeks away and so is AWS re:Invent 2023 in Las Vegas. So let's prepare for the most important event of the year (I'm talking about re:Invent) in style:
This time we meet at the IBM Watson Tower and get food and drinks sponsored by Nordcloud.

For office security please provide your real first and last name during the registration!

AGENDA:
18:30 - Doors open, networking, drinks, food

19:00 - Markus Ostertag (AWS Hero): Recent AWS announcements

20:00 - Arvid Ottenberg, Lars Dittert, Christian Ungnadner (IBM) - Innovating Vehicle Connectivity: A Serverless IoT Approach on AWS

21:00 - Henrik Andersson (BMW) & Marco Hutzsch (Nordcloud): Management of a massive AWS Environment is (Server)less work!

21:45 - More drinks, more networking

If you have an office or co-working space where we can meet (100-150 people), want to sponsor drinks/food or have a (lightning) talk you want to present - please let us know!

Everyone who participates in an AWS UG Munich event must adhere to the Code of Conduct!
