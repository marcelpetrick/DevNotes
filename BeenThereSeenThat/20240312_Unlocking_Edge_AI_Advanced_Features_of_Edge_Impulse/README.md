Unlocking Edge AI: Advanced Features of Edge Impulse

Take your edge AI projects and solutions even further with our advanced features workshop. In this webinar, you will learn about the latest, most powerful capabilities of Edge Impulse such as enhanced model tuning and optimization, new deployment options, BYOM (bring your own model), visual anomaly detection, and more. Throughout this workshop, you’ll learn how to manage machine learning for the edge, including data pipelines, signal processing, ML training, model testing, and creating a deployable model that can run efficiently on any edge device, from MCU to MPU to GPU.

Join the workshop, “Unlocking Edge AI: Advanced Features of Edge Impulse”, and learn from Edge Impulse lead engineer Louis Moreau, connect with other developers, and get your questions answered. Register early and get a chance to win a Jetson Nano.

Learn how to:

    Handle complex data pipelines
    Use the latest advanced features of Edge Impulse such as model tuning and optimization, visual anomaly detection, and new deployment options
    Reduce RAM and ROM usage in ML models without sacrificing accuracy or increasing latency
    Deploy ML models to any edge device, gateway, or Docker container
