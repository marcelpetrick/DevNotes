On October 2nd we have the pleasure to see two talks: David Sautter will talk about refactoring and Lukas Bergdoll will talk about the compromises between safety and performance.

***

Title: We do not have time to refactor!

Presenter: David Sautter, Web UI Developer and clean code advocate at Rohde & Schwarz. David is a senior software developer and project lead at Rohde & Schwarz, with a focus on web technologies. He has a strong interest in code maintainability and regularly leads internal trainings on the topic. As a seasoned developer and project lead, he brings a wealth of experience to the subject of refactoring. In this talk, he will share his insights and expertise on how to improve code quality and maintainability.

Abstract: In the fast-paced world of software development, there always seems to be something more urgent than refactoring. However, without regular refactoring, software can quickly turn into an expensive nightmare. This talk will explore effective negotiation strategies for securing the right amount of time for refactoring. Drawing also from his experience teaching Rohde & Schwarz software teams about the value of maintainable software through Clean Code Caf√©s, David will provide practical tips and tricks and delve into how to strike the right balance between refactoring, feature development, and bug fixes.

Title: Safety vs Performance. A case study of C, C++ and Rust sort implementations

Presenter: Lukas Bergdoll, Lukas Bergdoll is a self-taught C++ developer, long-time MUC++ co-organizer and FOSS developer with commercial experience in building distributed systems, security critical software, compilers, interpreters, in-memory databases and language interfaces. At heart a curious mind, he aspires to see the world for what it could be.

Abstract: With 70 years of theoretical and practical exploration, sort algorithms are among the oldest and most famous problems in computer science. Where does safety even come into the picture when sorting a collection of elements? What is the performance impact of safety in the context of sorting? How do popular implementations in C, C++ and Rust compare? Be there and find out.
