Artificial Intelligence - Hype & Reality: Will the Terminator Ransomware arrive soon? by Lukas Nester (Acronis)
In this thought-provoking session, we explore the intriguing intersection of artificial intelligence, its surrounding hype, and the realistic implications for the future.
Delving into the question of whether the dreaded Terminator Ransomware is on the horizon, we provide valuable insights on the actual risks and challenges we face in the AI landscape.

NLP in Radio NASCAR Communications by Adriano Persegani (Constructor Learning)
In the adrenaline-fueled realm of NASCAR, AI and Deep Learning are transforming strategic decision-making. This project delves into how teams utilize real-time radio communication data, processed through advanced Deep Learning models, to gain a competitive edge. We'll explore the intricacies of data preparation, and the implementation of NLP techniques, showcasing a practical application of these technologies in the high-stakes world of NASCAR racing.

Credit risk analytics with machine learning by Fares Djerourou (UniCredit)
At a time when some significant banks are going bankrupt the question of a looming financial crisis is always being raised. What have banks done since the 2007 crisis to prevent such events from happening again? In this talk we will go through the modeling procedure adopted by banks when it comes to assessing their credit portfolio risk, we will be taking a practical example with real loan data and go through the data preparation as well as the machine learning models being used by financial institutions to meet capital requirements.
