# 20240426 Getting Started with the Yocto Project - by Doulos
* hosted by Doulos
* thanks to Partner Microchip
* Adrian Thomasset - Doulos Senior Member Technical Staff

## agenda today
* creating custo linux distributions
* usin a yocto bsp for the
* adding new software to a distribution
![](img00.png)
* compnents of a linux system: boot loader, kernel, c runtime library (glibc), shell/utilities (bussybox)
![](img01.png)
* these components are well understood
* choices: software and versions: busybox, toybox, musl
* compiler and tools: gcc, clang, rust
* security (eg. SELinux)
* enabled/disable drivers

* this results in the creation of a linux system implementation = "distro"
* packages, grpahcs support, SELinux, Bluetooth, Wifi
![](img02.png)
* maybe using a common framework?

## what is the yocto project?
* it is not an embedded linux distribution, t creates a custom one for you!

* part of the linux foundation
* what is an automated build system?
  * fetch source code, configure and compile and package binaries, create filesystem
  * the open embedded build system is described of meta data: like tasks and configurtions
![](img05.png)
* build system metadata: recipes, classes, configurations
* recipes are a list of tasks
![](img06.png)
* the base class tasks: src_uri is just pointing to a task server
![](img07.png)
  * build system recipes inherit some classes, inheritance, includes git
* the build system: metadata and tasks
![](img08.png)
* open embeded as common build system
![](img09.png)
* build system = metadata + bitbake

[missed some info - TODO get from recording]

* default user always `root`; no password

## PolarFire SoC

* https://github.com/polarfire-soc/meta-polarfire-soc-yocto-bsp
* adding additional layers:
* a tool called  `repo`, which points to manifest as xml file
  * downloads all metalayers instead just one
* poky build system:

![](img16.png)
* conf/machine/ should already offer a configuration file for your target
* yocto build-system crosscompiles a compiler for you!
![](img17.png)
* `bitbke -s` for the list of packages
## let's add GnuChess!
* create a new layer: don't modify base-layers

![](img20.png)
* lot of time spent on building packages
* sysroot? TODO
* cooker mode opposed to sdk mode?
