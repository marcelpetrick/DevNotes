# 20230726 Employing Coredumps to Debug Your Embedded Devices

## Invitation:
```
Do you have a memory allocator that needs usage monitoring? Add it to your coredump! Or sensor data that causes a unique stack overflow? Add it to your coredump!
We know firsthand how difficult identifying and solving the root causes of firmware faults is, particularly for devices in the field. Local debugging and logging subsystems are commonly used to determine the issue cause, however, these tools are limited and invasive. This is where coredumps become helpful! Coredumps, an underutilized debugging resource, can provide valuable insights as they contain highly structured data that can be easily parsed.
Join this webinar as our Firmware Solutions Engineer, Eric Johnson, introduces you to coredumps and how to use them in practice. Eric will demo and example of coredumps with Zephyr, and youâ€™ll learn how to: 
Capture details insights into faults with coredumps
Use GDB with a coredump
Utilize Memfault to collect coredumps on any embedded MCU, Linux, or Android devices
```
