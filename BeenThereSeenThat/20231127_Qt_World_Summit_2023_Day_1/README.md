# 20231127 Qt World Summit 2023 - Day 1

kate . am.i a good.programme
wants to be a good programmer

people.fulled with doubt and worry
payingher since 1979 to write code. says nothing aboutntoday
not arcitect, manager, cbersecurity, not a good person or not
but typing code does what sou habe planned for tld o
pipes dont elak, table sturdy for table
dnd people..lawful.good, lawful.evil
nut about capable or competent
or about great
worst person in theroomsthinks they are the best person in room
dunning kruger skills
being good causes you to not evaluate well
if you cant tell you are sucxessfully sining a note
but id asked to throw baseball.
misestimates skill yb largest round. the worst
if you think you are a 8. then maybe 7,8,9 or 10
for self assessments
people thunkt hey are great when they are awfzl..also awful.when thry are great
everyone got the same sozed hubnle, but different ones. this is how trams work
in order to learn do something you did jot know jow to donit
their little faces light up for learning
learnwith joy and eleight and pride
good tutorial, teaxher, framework,..
being uncomfortable does not.meanèµ°are learning
learning and growing: the more you learna dn know, the more you know you habe to learn
is wondering actually enough?
bad programmers exist
just wantin to be good does not make.you good
same peolle wil.do better in a different job
green bathroom.tile not a good metric
not any meaningful.way of self.evalution
non metrics: github records, who hired you, time.as a independant, 
the mere passage of time.does prove anything, some.things can be used as proxies
#how can you know?
a test.by three.questions: do.other people.ask your advicr, do you enjoy it, have you avoided the most outrageous catstrophes?
outrageous catastrophr for developrr:
problem produxtion - no
realizing afzer motnhs of work thwt a baic assumptionndoes jot hold
creating something unmaintainable.to.thwt nobody wanta to touch it
failing to consider.to test something vital (security, scaling, ..)
others ask you advice; did thy apply.it?
people.fillow your twitter or blog, ..
the real.key: enkoying it, do you like writing code?
does this person enjoy programming? second part: doing it in theirnfreee time? would you even donitnwhen you won the lottery?
* emotions in code?


-----
data proxessing
2.8 gbyte/s 160 ms.e to e delay
identifying the right partnerships.is key
qt quick good.to hit the ground running good, also convenient
mix.of qt3d and opengl
want to.bzild the futrue.of cardio imaging
direct transfer betwern the 3 gpu. share textures. get everythingnreally.effixiently to screen

mmmmmm

markomklementti , eficode - dev ops pipeline
strongpoint for ci/cd
strramluning the devopsnpieline
    1. agile feedbakc loops: conways law..complicated architectures for compicated comapines: team.topoligies lead to.buildinf services as api: selforgsnized teams are allowed to rrleaee more.often
    2.creating new embedded products is jot synchronized: software and hardware.meet on thr same.maturity levels. then ship, butssw  xontinues to imrpive
    3.build.autonation and traceability: ci is perfect plave to collect sbom
    4.
security shift left
5..cognitive load.for developers. team tpology, platform.topolyg, ficus on the core business
6..measuring success
dora devops metrics often fall short
mean time.to.recober deployment frequency
change filure rate
lead.time.for.a.releaee.candidate - else you keep theorganization slow
automated test coverage
cost of delay
ratio of.modular dependencies

mmmmmm

qt will.continue to support steongly cross platform
os versions release and qt timeline for feature freeze have thrmnin mind
qt6 for direct hardware platform.support
multimidal.user interfacws..multiple.users in the ame application..speehninterfaces.
twxt to speech api, speech recognitionnisnsalso.researched

qt6 and RHI: efficient inzegration eith openxr
qt quick 3d..create 3d scenes with qml.and js
create more.in less time!
ready made solutions, from.ui to neteork
high level kodules for visualizing data
not want to reinvent the wheel
integrwtion to 3rd party solutions like.ooencv, tensorflow, authentication frameworks
connevred first. gRPC, MqTt, coapp, http, qt remote objects, opc UA
cBwr secueity..eu resilience act,.usa.cBersecuritx act..for connected evices. guidelines for qt, dor things which could be problematic..also.for.conpliiance
four eye oricniocle for evwry commit..at least reviewed by someone else..anybody can contribute, but wvrything is reviewed..also runs though the CI
also fuzz testing fot things whichnhandle untrusted data, hardening those intefaves
if there are CVEs. they will be analyzed, the maintainers are informed, then disclosed
language wise security: cpp committee, makr the language more secuee and safer to use
language development cpp20 or cpp23, also for rust and python
qt6 as cpp17.requirement
tension between.on the edge developers, and regulated areas
questions:
qt qml.or widgets? qt wuicj as first class technology. highlyndeclarwtive, designer friendly, hwrswsre acxellerwted. but qt focuess on qt quick.
printingnto the qtpdf module?
peoblem eith qt macros and the cpp23 modules
