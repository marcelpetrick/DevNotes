    Talk #1: E2E MLOps platform at BSH
    While most companies are now familiar with the requirements of a good DevOps process, the situation is still not on the same level of maturity for end-to-end MLOps processes that are required to train, test, deploy, run, and monitor ML models in production.
    Generally, MLOps can be considered as an extension of DevOps. The same principles that are valid for professional software development, also apply in the context of ML development, but the complexity is much higher.
    For complete reproducibility of the status of an ML product, at least two artifacts are needed in MLOps (versioned code & model), and ideally, versioned data as a third artifact, while in DevOps only one is required (versioned code).
    Additionally, model training and optimization need special tools for experiment tracking. And finally, the behavior of productive models needs to be monitored with new concepts and tools, in contrast to traditional application monitoring.
    To bring our ML use cases faster into production, we designed and implemented a concept for a generic, modular end-to-end platform that provides components for all the necessary steps from initial data preparation, over-training, experiment tracking, testing, deployment, running, and monitoring in production.
    In my talk I want to answer the questions of why we decided to build our own platform as well as how we built it, i.e. I'll give a short overview of the current state of our platform.
    Talk #2: Fine-tuning in the Era of Large Models

About our speakers:
