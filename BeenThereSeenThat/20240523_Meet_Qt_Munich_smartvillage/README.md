# 20240523 Meet Qt Munich - smartvillage

* shoutout to Michael Zuchtriegel for recognizing me :sweat:

## Intro by JAkub: about next events ..
* Qt World Summit in 2025 in Munich

## Maurice Kalinowski

### Qt on the desktop and mobile
* cross platform is more important than ever:
 * ongoing ARM recvolution
 * upcoming OS fragmentation
* tighter integration with OS services
* connecting to cloud services
* cover 90% of the active Android MArket (Vladimir does this): always the next Qt version to come will cover this; 6 month-evaluation; not just "putting a finger into the sky"

### Qt and XR
* Qt has always been about cross platform
  * target apple vision pro 3
  * meta quest 3
  * from CES: asus, sony, xReal and TCL will come
* new design domain - spatial computing

### goals
* become the reference framework to create XR exeperiences
* multi-platform Qt support

### GenAI is everywhere
* ![]() - image of the genai todo
* generate all test-cases when you have introspection: should be easy - Qt company looks into those fields

### Open platform
* software architecture is getting more complex every day: different frameworks, platforms, languages
* vision: make QML and Qt Quck the moder UI framework for everyone
* seamless integration without any glue
* available already:
  * Qt for Python
  * Qt/.NET/C#
  * CxxQt/Rust

### Qt on Embedded
* Qt provides true chipset independence
* new hardware: from NXP, TI, Boundary devices, Infineon, StarFive (RISC-V) - scale through partnering
* update operating version support
  *  embedded linux/Yocto/Debian, QNX, Integrity, VxWorks
* Performance Evaluation App: an image, which "just" has to be flashed, run and gives "all" the results

### Qt Development in the cloud
* Boot2Qt AMI in AWS marketplace
* shift hardware selection tot he right
* accelerate prototyping
* harmonize your development setups
* cloud scalability on your needs
* EC2 Development Host <-> AWS Gravitron ARM vECU <-cloud->Boot to Qt Software Stack
* stream the UI via WebGL to the user
* this can put the hardware decision into the right point in time
* what if I could have something running in the cloud:

### Qt Design Studio Strategic Goal
* figma integration
* 3d UI integration
* 2D UI creation
* enable smooth workflow between Qt Design Studio and QtCreator
* optimize QML code for selected Qt target: Qt6/Qt Quick Ultralight (?)

### Qt Creator strategic goals
* productivity: capability ofhandling projects with thoussands of files, quick startu time, ai-boosted suggestions
* user experience: easy configuration and customization, modern ui that supports productivity
* scalability: possible to extend the functionality via extensions, a wide selection of tool extensions available, additional LLMs, support for additional programming lnauges
  * preview for changes of the ABI
