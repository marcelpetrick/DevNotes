* cgpt had alsways a lag in response, also needed sometimes several hints to get to the correct answer
* with cgpt this changed drastically
## how not to use it ..
* "bad code can be cleaned zp, but it is very expensive." robert c. martin

* backtracking and clarifying existing bad code is expensive in time and money, should be avoided
* don't rely on it to learn to code

+ don't build code whiche needs lots of context

* code needs to be readible for other developers
* take the error message, also add 2-3 lines of code to cgpt, then the result should give you some insight: but you can also infleucne it by "eplain it to me like i am a child" or "like i mam a software engineer" (haha)
