## Where does it make sense to do edge ML projects vs. where not?
[todo: ask for slides]

## Welding quality assessment using sound
* acoustic emission monitoring as an in-process quality method for welding processes - Koen Faes
* welding as most important fabrication technique
* inherently generate defects due to the proess complexity
* detected after fabrication
* presence of defects: wasted production time, energy or raw materials; increased production costs, delivery delays; safety consequences
* vital to detect defects as soon as possible: during the production process; to intervene qucikly and repair
* weld quality is becoming more important: customer expectation increase
* quality inspection: expensive, time-consuming, selective, done off-line, after production; sometimes not possible in a non-destructive way
## acoustic emission monitoring
* detecting low level sound waves, which are produced during plastic deformation; can be deteted using piezo-eletric sensors
* AE source: cracks
* investigation of AEM because of: real-time inspection technique, small sized sensors, cost effective
* AW signal analysis: wavestream data:
[img for AE signal analysis]
  * vast amount of signals captured; AI allows a more efficient analysis
  * AVANGARD-project did this for arc-welding: trying to find correlation between weld- defects and the AEM measurements
  * test-series: tried different welding modes and parameters to gather data
  * another series: fillet welds with pulsed welding
  * recorded sounds: 20 min; converted to spectrograms

  * prediction accuracy of 85%: of the used welding condition -> not a direct way to detect defects
  * most important defects: lack of penetration or lack of fusion
